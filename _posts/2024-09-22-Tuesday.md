Today’s WOD will provide a great full body workout! You will begin by biking for 36/30 calories and performing 20 kettlebell swings, then 30/25 calories and 20 kettlebell swings, then 24/20 calories and 20 kettlebell swings, then 18/15 calories and 20 kettlebell swings, and finally 12/10 calories and a last 20 kettlebell swings. (The first number listed is the suggested number of calories for men and the second is the suggested number of calories for women. Do what is right for you.) Push hard, and try to get it done as quickly as possible! You can do it!
