[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

For today’s workout, you will perform as many rounds as you can of 2 wall walks, 4 push jerks, 6 power cleans, and 8 box jumps during the 14 minute workout period. Pick scaling options that allow you to keep moving steadily. Push hard and move fast, but as always, be careful especially on the wall walks and the box jumps! Scale the wall walks as needed as you fatigue, and lower the box height or switch to box step-ups if you start to feel shaky!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**14 minute AMRAP:**

**2 wall walks**

**4 push jerks (95lb, 65lb)**

**6 power cleans (95lb, 65lb)**

**8 box jumps (24in., 20in.)**
<!--more-->

Beginners can substitute inchworms for wall walks and dumbbell push jerks and power cleans for barbell push jerks and power cleans. They can also reduce the height of the box jumps or perform box step-ups instead. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**14 minute AMRAP:**

**2 inchworms**

**4 dumbbell push jerks or push presses (8lb, 5lb)**

**6 dumbbell power cleans (8lb, 5lb)**

**8 box jumps or box step-ups to a comfortable height**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**14 minute AMRAP:**

**2 partial wall walks or 4 inchworm push-ups**

**4 push jerks (65lb, 45lb)**

**6 power cleans (65lb, 45lb)**

**8 box jumps to a comfortable height**

Your score is the total number of rounds and reps you complete during the 14 minute AMRAP.
