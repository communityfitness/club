TGIF, Community Fitness Club! We will end the week with two rounds of 30/24 calories on the air bike (30 calories for men, 24 calories for women), 25 power cleans, and 20 handstand push-ups. Feel free to modify the rep scheme and movements as needed today, especially the handstand push-ups. You’ll still get in a good workout even if you scale!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**2 rounds for time:**

**30/24 calorie air bike**

**25 power cleans (95lb, 65lb)**

**20 handstand push-ups**
<!--more-->

Beginners can reduce the number of calories performed on the air bike each round. They can also substitute dumbbell power cleans for the barbell power cleans and dumbbell push presses for the handstand push-ups. Do what’s right for you! A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**2 rounds for time:**

**20/16 calorie air bike**

**25 dumbbell power cleans (8lb, 5lb)**

**20 dumbbell push presses (8lb, 8lb)**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**For time:**

**25/20 calorie air bike**

**25 power cleans (65lb, 45lb)**

**20 box handstand push-ups**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
