It’s Monday, Community Fitness Club! We will start our week with a 15 minute AMRAP. AMRAP stands for “As Many Reps As Possible,” so in today’s workout we will perform as many rounds and repetitions of 20 double unders, 10 dumbbell overhead walking lunges, and 5 burpees as we can in the 15 minute time limit. Work hard, but be smart! Pick the scaling options that are right for you today!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**20 double unders**

**10 dumbbell overhead walking lunges (35lb, 25lb)**

**5 burpees**
<!--more-->

Beginners can modify the burpees and the lunges as needed today. Check out the links at the bottom of the post for more information on how to modify these movements. Single unders or imaginary jump rope can also be substituted for the double unders if desired. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**15 single unders or 30 imaginary jump rope**

**10 modified lunges**

**5 elevated, no push-up burpees**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**10 double unders or 40 single unders**

**10 dumbbell walking lunges (35lb, 25lb)**

**5 step-back burpees**

Your score is the total number of rounds and reps you complete during today’s workout.
