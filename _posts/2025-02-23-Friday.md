Thank goodness it’s Friday, Community Fitness Club! Let’s end the month with a simple WOD containing three familiar exercises: the air bike, push-ups, and sit-ups. For today’s workout, you will complete 10 rounds of 5/6 calories on the air bike, 10 push-ups, and 15 sit-ups. Push hard, get it done, and then go enjoy your weekend!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**10 rounds for time:**

**5/6 calorie air bike**

**10 push-ups**

**15 abmat sit-ups**
<!--more-->

A beginner can modify the rep scheme and the movements to make today’s workout more doable. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**8 rounds for time:**

**3/4 calorie air bike**

**8 wall push-ups**

**10 anchored or assisted sit-ups**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**10 rounds for time:**

**4/5 calorie air bike**

**10 kneeling or box push-ups or 5 regular push-ups**

**12 abmat sit-ups**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
