Today’s WOD (“Workout of the Day”) is a 15 minute EMOM (“Every Minute On the Minute”). In the first minute of the workout you will perform 25 Russian kettlebell swings; in the second minute you will perform 15 box jumps; and in the third minute you will air bike for as many calories as possible. Continue like this for 5 rounds, trying to accumulate as many calories on the air bike as possible. Work hard! You can do it!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**15 minute EMOM:**

**Minute 1: 25 Russian kettlebell swings (71lb, 53lb)**

**Minute 2: 15 box jumps (24in., 20in.)**

**Minute 3: air bike for max calories**
<!--more-->

Today’s WOD can be scaled by adjusting the rep scheme and by reducing the weight of the kettlebell and the height of the box. Also feel free to perform box step-ups rather than box jumps if you need to. Do what’s right for you today! A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**15 minute EMOM:**

**Minute 1: 20 Russian kettlebell swings (15lb, 10lb)**

**Minute 2: 10 box jumps or 16 box step-ups to a comfortable height**

**Minute 3: air bike for max calories**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**15 minute EMOM:**

**Minute 1: 25 Russian kettlebell swings (53lb, 35lb)**

**Minute 2: 15 box jumps to a comfortable height**

**Minute 3: air bike for max calories**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total number of air bike calories you accumulate during today’s workout.
