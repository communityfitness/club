[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up) 

TGIF, Community Fitness Club! We will close out the week with a tabata-style workout. In a tabata, you perform a given movement for eight rounds of 20 seconds of work and 10 seconds of rest. 

In the first tabata of today’s WOD, you will cycle through each scale variation twice. That is, you will perform a front scale on your left foot for 20 seconds, then a front scale on your right foot for 20 seconds, then a back scale on your left foot for 20 seconds, then a back scale on your right foot for 20 seconds. You will then repeat all four movements one more time. 

In the second tabata, you will bear crawl. Try to bear crawl both forward and backward during today’s workout. The last three tabatas will consist of Superman holds, broad jumps, and flutter kicks.

To time today’s workout using the SmartWOD timer app:

1. Select “TABATA”. 
2. Choose 8 rounds of 0:20 work, 0:10 rest.
3. Press the plus sign beside “Add sets (optional)”.
4. Coose 5 sets with 1 minute of rest between sets. 
5. Press “START TIMER”.

Everyone will be performing the same workout today. The only differences will be in how you modify the movements to your personal fitness level, how long you are able to hold the movements, and how many reps of the movements you are able to do. Do your best today, and that will be good enough!
