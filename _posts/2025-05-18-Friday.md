Thank goodness it’s Friday, Community Fitness Club! Let’s end the week with a (hopefully) fun workout! Every 3 minutes of today’s WOD, we will perform 8 light deadlifts, 6 hang power cleans, and then we will air bike for maximum calories for the remainder of the 3-minute period. We will repeat this same sequence for 6 rounds until the 18 minutes are up.

To time today’s workout using the SmartWOD timer app:

(1) Press “EMOM”. 

(2) Select “Every 3 for 18”. 

(3) Press "START TIMER".

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**Every 3 minutes for 18 minutes:**

**8 deadlifts (125lb, 85lb)**

**6 hang power cleans (125lb, 85lb)**

**Then air bike for max calories**

Beginners can perform dumbbell deadlifts and dumbbell hang power cleans instead of their barbell counterparts. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**Every 3 minutes for 18 minutes:**

**8 dumbbell deadlifts (12lb, 8lb)**

**6 dumbbell hang power cleans (12lb, 8lb)**

**Then air bike for max calories**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**Every 3 minutes for 18 minutes:**

**8 deadlifts (75lb, 55lb)**

**6 hang power cleans (75lb, 55lb)**

**Then air bike for max calories**

Your score is the total number of air bike calories you accumulate during the 18 minute workout.
