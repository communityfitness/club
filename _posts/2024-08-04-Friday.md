[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

We will end the week with a 15 minute AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”) containing box jumps, kettlebell deadlifts, double unders, and push-ups. If you’re feeling tired after a long week of working out, feel free to move a little slower and take longer breaks. If you’re feeling strong, push hard and get in as many reps as possible!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**10 box jumps (24in., 20in.)**

**20 kettlebell deadlifts (71lb, 53lb)**

**30 double unders**

**10 push-ups**
<!--more-->

Beginners please modify today’s workout as needed, especially if you’ve been working out all week. If your body doesn’t want to jump, you can replace the box jumps with box step-ups. If kettlebell deadlifts are difficult for you, reduce the number of repeitions. Like I said on Monday, the goal is to do _something_. You don’t have to do _everything_. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**8 box jumps or 8 box step-ups to a comfortable height**

**16 kettlebell deadlifts (20lb, 15lb)**

**16 single unders or 32 imaginary jump rope**

**8 wall push-ups**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**10 box jumps to a comfortable height**

**20 kettlebell deadlifts (53lb, 35lb)**

**15 double unders or 60 single unders**

**10 kneeling or box push-ups or 5 regular push-ups**

Your score is the total number of rounds and reps you complete during the 15 minute AMRAP.
