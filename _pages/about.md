## WELCOME TO THE COMMUNITY FITNESS CLUB!

Gyms can be scary, intimidating places. It's hard to know what to do, how to do it, and where to start. That is where the Community Fitness Club comes in. Every weekday I will provide a Workout of the Day (WOD) along with scaling options and links to tutorial videos. You simply complete the WOD to the best of your abilities and record your results.

The Community Fitness Club is not about chasing perfection. Instead, it is about pushing your limits in the gym so that you feel stronger, more confident, and more capable in your everyday life. I hope that together we can build a community that supports and encourages each other as we pursue our individual fitness goals and train for life.
