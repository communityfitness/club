[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

TGIF, Community Fitness Club! To end the week strong, we will perform 10 power cleans and 5 thrusters, followed by 8 hang power cleans and 4 thrusters. We will then rest for 90 seconds before completing 8 power cleans and 4 thrusters, followed by 6 hang power cleans and 3 thrusters. We will then rest another 90 seconds and will then perform 6 power cleans and 3 thrusters, followed by 4 hang power cleans and 2 thrusters. We will then rest another 90 seconds before performing our last round of 4 power cleans and 2 thrusters, followed by 2 hang power cleans and 1 thruster. Try to really push for speed each round, and use the rest periods to recover. 

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

Beginners can modify both the movements and the weights. Substitute dumbbell power cleans and dumbbell thrusters for their barbell versions. If dumbbell thrusters aren’t right for you today, you can also substitute air squats or sit-to-stands. A beginner version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**For time:**

**10 dumbbell power cleans**

**5 dumbbell thrusters, air squats, or sit-to-stands**

**8 dumbbell hang power cleans**

**4 dumbbell thrusters, air squats, or sit-to-stands**

****Rest 90 seconds***

**8 dumbbell power cleans**

**4 dumbbell thrusters, air squats, or sit-to-stands**

**6 dumbbell hang power cleans**

**3 dumbbell thrusters, air squats, or sit-to-stands**

****Rest 90 seconds***

**6 dumbbell power cleans**

**3 dumbbell thrusters, air squats, or sit-to-stands**

**4 dumbbell hang power cleans**

**2 dumbbell thrusters, air squats, or sit-to-stands**

****Rest 90 seconds***

**4 dumbbell power cleans**

**2 dumbbell thrusters, air squats, or sit-to-stands**

**2 dumbbell hang power cleans**

**1 dumbbell thrusters, air squats, or sit-to-stands**

****Use 8/5 pound dumbbells for all movements***

It is also completely okay to do something in between the experienced version and the beginner version. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**For time:**

**10 power cleans**

**5 thrusters**

**8 hang power cleans**

**4 thrusters**

****Rest 90 seconds***

**8 power cleans**

**4 thrusters**

**6 hang power cleans**

**3 thrusters**

****Rest 90 seconds***

**6 power cleans**

**3 thrusters**

**4 hang power cleans**

**2 thrusters**

****Rest 90 seconds***

**4 power cleans**

**2 thrusters**

**2 hang power cleans**

**1 thruster**

****Use 65/45 pound barbell for all movements***

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout. Include the rest times between rounds in your final score.
