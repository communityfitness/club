[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

It’s Monday, Community Fitness Club, and our first workout of the week will be a 12 minute AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”). The goal of today’s workout is to complete as many rounds of 15 wall balls and 9 calories on the rower as you can in the 12 minute time limit. Pick a wall ball weight that allows you to move through at least the first several rounds unbroken. You should be able to rack up a lot of rounds before the 12 minutes are over!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**12 minute AMRAP:**

**15 wall balls (20lb, 14lb)**

**10 calorie row**
<!--more-->

Beginners can perform wall ball goblet squats, air squats, or sit-to-stands instead of wall balls if needed. The rep scheme can also be altered. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**12 minute AMRAP:**

**9 wall balls, wall ball goblet squats, air squats, or sit-to-stands**

**6 calorie row**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**12 minute AMRAP:**

**12 wall balls (14lb, 10lb)**

**8 calorie row**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total number of rounds and reps you complete during today’s workout.
