[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up) 

TGIF, Community Fitness Club! We will end the week with 8 rounds of 10 light deadlifts, 6 hang power cleans, and 8 push-ups. Push hard, and end this week on a high note! Also, remember to change your clocks this Sunday!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**8 rounds for time:**

**10 deadlifts (115lb, 75lb)**

**6 hang power cleans (115lb, 75lb)**

**8 push-ups**
<!--more-->

Beginners can reduce the total number of rounds and modify the movements to make today’s workout more doable. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**6 rounds for time:**

**10 dumbbell deadlifts (8lb, 5lb)**

**6 dumbbell hang power cleans (8lb, 5lb)**

**8 wall push-ups**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**8 rounds for time:**

**10 deadlifts (75lb, 55lb)**

**6 hang power cleans (75lb, 55lb)**

**8 kneeling or box push-ups or 4 regular push-ups**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
