[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Today’s workout consists of calories on the air bike and empty barbell thrusters. In six two-minute intervals, you will bike for 12/10 calories (12 calories for men, 10 calories for women) and then perform as many thrusters as possible in the remaining time. You will then have one and a half minutes to rest before beginning the next round. Try to pace yourself during the early rounds. You don’t want to go so hard on the first round that you burn yourself out for the rest of the workout. 

To time today’s workout using the SmartWOD app, use the following steps:

1. Press “TABATA”.
2. Choose 6 rounds of 2:00 work and 1:30 rest.
3. Press “START TIMER”.

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**Six 2-minute rounds for max thrusters:**

**12/10 calorie air bike**

**Max effort thrusters (45lb, 35lb)**

***Rest 1:30 minutes between rounds***

A beginner can scale today’s WOD by reducing the number of air bike calories performed per round and by substituting dumbbell thrusters, air squats, or sit-to-stands for the barbell thrusters. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**Six 2-minute rounds for max thrusters:**

**8/6 calorie air bike**

**Max effort dumbbell thrusters (5lb, 3lb) or air squats or sit-to-stands**

***\*Rest 1:30 minutes between rounds***

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**Six 2-minute rounds for max thrusters:**

**10/8 calorie air bike**

**Max effort thrusters (45lb, 35lb)**

***\*Rest 1:30 minutes between rounds***

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total number of thrusters you complete during today’s workout.
