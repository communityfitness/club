It’s Tabata Tuesday, Community Fitness Club! 

In the first tabata of today’s WOD, you will cycle through each scale variation twice. That is, you will perform a front scale on your left foot for 20 seconds, then a front scale on your right foot for 20 seconds, then a back scale on your left foot for 20 seconds, then a back scale on your right foot for 20 seconds. You will then repeat all four movements one more time and then rest for one minute. 

In the second tabata of today’s WOD, you will alternate between 20 seconds of box jumps and 20 seconds of bear crawl. After a one minute rest, you will continue on to the third tabata, where you will alternate between lunges and high knees. After another one minute rest, you will perform the fourth tabata in which you will alternate between flutter kicks and Superman hold. Then you will rest for one last one-minute interval, before continuing on to the fifth and final tabata where you will alternate between push-ups and mountain climbers.

To time today’s workout using the SmartWOD timer app:

(1) Press “TABATA”. 

(2) Select 8 rounds of 0:20 work, 0:10 rest. 

(3) Click on the plus sign beside “Add sets”. 

(4) Select 5 sets with 1 minute of rest between sets.

**Tabata 1 - Scales (front left, front right, back left, back right)**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 5 - Alternate between push-ups and mountain climbers**

Tabatas scale automatically. A beginner will naturally perform fewer reps than an advanced athlete. However, it may be necessary to scale other aspects of the workout as well. You can modify the lunges by not lowering your back knee all the way to the ground and by holding onto something for support. You can reduce the height of the box jumps, and you can substitute wall push-ups for regular push-ups. You can perform flutter kicks with bent knees instead of straight legs, and you can march in place rather than doing high knees. Make the changes that are right for you today! A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**Experienced:**

**Tabata 1 - Scales (front left, front right, back left, back right)**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 2 - Alternate between box jumps to a comfortable height and bear crawl**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 3 - Alternate between modified lunges and march-in-place**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 4 - Alternate between flutter kicks and Superman hold (broken as needed)**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 5 - Alternate between wall push-ups and mountain climbers**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**Experienced:**

**Tabata 1 - Scales (front left, front right, back left, back right)**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 2 - Alternate between box jumps to a comfortable height and bear crawl**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 3 - Alternate between alternating lunges and high knees**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 4 - Alternate between flutter kicks and Superman hold (broken as needed)**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 5 - Alternate between kneeling push-ups and mountain climbers**
