[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Today’s workout will begin with 15/12 calories on the air bike (15 calories for men, 12 calories for women), followed by 5 rounds of 5 pull-ups, 10 burpees, 15 sit-ups, and 20 kettlebell deadlifts, and it will end with another 15/12 calories on the air bike. Push hard today! You should definitely feel a difference between the biking buy-in at the beginning of the workout and the buy-out at the end!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**For time:**

**Buy-in: 15/12 calorie air bike**

**Buy-out: 15/12 calorie air bike**

If this type of workout is new to you, you can modify the movements and the rep scheme. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**For time:**

**Buy-in: 10/8 calorie air bike**

**5 rounds:**

**4 ring rows**

**8 elevated, no push-up burpees**

**12 anchored or assisted sit-ups**

**16 kettlebell deadlifts (20lb, 15lb)**

**Buy-out: 10/8 calorie air bike**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**For time:**

**Buy-in: 12/10 calorie air bike**

**5 rounds:**

**5 jumping or banded pull-ups**

**10 step-back burpees**

**15 abmat sit-ups**
