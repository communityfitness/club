Today’s WOD is a quick 12-minute AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”) in which we will complete as many rounds of 8 dumbbell walking lunges, 10 American kettlebell swings, and 12 sit-ups as we can in the 12-minute time period. Try to keep your sets as unbroken as possible, and really push hard to get in as many rounds and repetitions as you can! You can do it!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**12 minute AMRAP:**

**8 dumbbell walking lunges (35lb, 25lb)**

**10 American kettlebell swings (53lb, 35lb)**

**12 abmat sit-ups**
<!--more-->

AMRAPs scale automatically. A beginner will naturally perform fewer repetitions than an advanced athlete. However, it is often necessary to scale other aspects of the workout as well. Consider modifying your lunges and sit-ups and performing Russian rather than American kettlebell swings. You can also modify the WOD’s rep scheme. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**12 minute AMRAP:**

**8 modified lunges**

**10 Russian kettlebell swings (20lb, 15lb)**

**8 anchored or assisted sit-ups**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**12 minute AMRAP:**

**8 dumbbell walking lunges (25lb, 15lb)**

**10 American kettlebell swings (35lb, 22lb)**

**12 abmat sit-ups**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total number of rounds and reps you complete during the 12-minute AMRAP.
