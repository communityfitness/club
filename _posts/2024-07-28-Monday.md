[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Happy Monday, Community Fitness Club! Today’s workout is a 15 minute AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”). Your goal today is to complete as many rounds of 5 pull-ups, 5 toes-to-bar, 10 burpees, and 40 double unders as you can during the 15 minute workout period. If possible, try to move straight from your pull-ups into your toes-to-bar without dropping down from the bar. If you have to reduce the number of pull-ups and toes-to-bar you perform each round to accomplish this goal, that’s okay! Pick the scaling options that are right for you today.

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

***15 minute AMRAP:***

***5 pull-ups***

***5 toes-to-bar***

***10 burpees***

***40 double unders***
<!--more-->

As always, beginning athletes can modify today’s workout. You can substitute ring rows for pull-ups, toes-to-rig for toes-to-bar, and imaginary jump rope or single unders for double unders. You can also pick whatever burpee modification works for you. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

***15 minute AMRAP:***

***5 ring rows***

***5 toes-to-rig***

***10 elevated, no push-up burpees***

***20 single unders or 40 imaginary jump rope***

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

***15 minute AMRAP:***

***2 pull-ups or 5 jumping or banded pull-ups***

***2 toes-to-bar or 5 hanging leg raises***

***10 step-back burpees***

***20 double unders or 80 single unders***
