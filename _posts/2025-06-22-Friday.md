[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

We will end this week with a 15 minute AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”). Try to complete as many rounds of 5 inchworm push-ups, 5 squat jumps, 10 up and down planks, and 10 Russian twists as you can. If you’re feeling tired, though, it’s okay to slow things down a bit. Doing something is always better than doing nothing!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**5 inchworm push-ups**

**5 squat jumps**

**10 up and down planks**

**10 Russian twists**
<!--more-->

Today’s WOD scales automatically. A beginner will naturally perform fewer repetitions than an advanced athlete. However, it may also be necessary to scale other aspects of the workout. Inchworms can be substituted for inchworm push-ups, and instead of doing full squat jumps, beginners can perform a small squat (where the thighs stay well above parallel) into a small hop. A plank hold can also be substituted for the up and down planks. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**2 inchworms**

**5 small, modified squat jumps or air squats or sit-to-stands**

**10 second plank hold**

**10 Russian twists**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**5 inchworms into kneeling push-ups**

**5 squat jumps**

**10 up and down planks**

**10 Russian twists**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total number of rounds and reps you complete during the 15 minute AMRAP.
