Today’s workout consists of 9 rounds of 5 push-ups, 10 dumbbell walking lunges, and 20 double unders. Each round will fly by, so really push today and finish as quickly as possible! 

If you are still working on perfecting your double unders, it is okay to reduce the number you perform each round. Try to pick a number that you can finish in 30 seconds or less. The only way to learn to do double unders is to practice!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**9 rounds for time:**

**5 push-ups**

**10 dumbbell walking lunges (50lb, 35lb)**

**20 double unders**
<!--more-->

Beginners can modify the movements and scale the number of rounds to make today’s WOD more doable. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**6 rounds for time:**

**5 wall push-ups**

**10 modified lunges**

**10 single unders or 30 imaginary jump rope**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**9 rounds for time:**

**5 kneeling push-ups or box push-ups**

**10 dumbbell walking lunges (30lb, 20lb)**

**10 double unders or 40 single unders**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
