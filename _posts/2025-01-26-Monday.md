[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Welcome to Burpee Week, Community Fitness Club! Every workout this week will contain that most-dreaded movement, the burpee. And though they say that familiarity breeds contempt, I have found that the opposite is true when it comes to hated exercises. The more you perform them, the less awful they become. So while I don’t expect that you’ll love burpees by the end of this week, I do hope that you come to hate them a *little* less.

For our first workout, we will complete as many rounds of 10 air squats, 10 sit-ups, 10 push-ups, 10 ring rows, and 10 burpees as we can in 10 minutes. This is a short one, so really push hard and get in as many rounds and repetitions as possible. You can do it!

Notice that even experienced athletes are performing ring rows today. Make the movement appropriately challenging by positioning yourself almost parallel to the floor or by putting your feet on a box. If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**10 minute AMRAP:**

**10 air squats**

**10 abmat sit-ups**

**10 push-ups**

**10 ring rows**

**10 burpees**
<!--more-->

The key to succeeding at any workout is to pick the modifications that are right for you on that particular day. Today, beginners can substitute sit-to-stands for air squats and wall push-ups for regular push-ups. The other movements can be scaled in multiple ways as well, and the rep scheme of the workout can be modified. Do what works for you! A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**10 minute AMRAP:**

**5 air squats or sit-to-stands**

**5 anchored or assisted sit-ups**

**5 wall push-ups**

**5 ring rows**

**5 elevated, no push-up burpees**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**10 minute AMRAP:**

**8 air squats**

**8 abmat sit-ups**

**8 kneeling or push-ups**

**8 ring rows**

**8 step-back burpees**

Your score is the total number of rounds and repetitions you complete during today’s workout.
