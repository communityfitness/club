Today’s WOD (“Workout of the Day”) is a 20 minute AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”) in which we will perform as many rounds of 10 deadlifts, 8 hang power cleans, 6 thrusters, 4 box jumps, and 2 wall walks as we can. This workout will allow you many chances to work on your wall walks. This is a great opportunity to improve this tricky movement! Consider spending a little extra time each round on the wall walks so that you can try a more difficult version of this movement than you usually perform. You can do it!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**20 minute AMRAP:**

**10 deadlifts (95lb, 65lb)**

**8 hang power cleans (95lb, 65lb)**

**6 thrusters (95lb, 65lb)**

**4 box jumps (24in., 20in.)**

**2 wall walks**
<!--more-->

Beginners can scale the movements, weights, and rep scheme. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**20 minute AMRAP:**

**5 dumbbell deadlifts (8lb, 5lb)**

**4 dumbbell hang power cleans (8lb, 5lb)**

**3 dumbbell thrusters (8lb, 5lb) or air squats or sit-to-stands**

**2 box jumps to a comfortable height**

**1 inchworm**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**20 minute AMRAP:**

**10 deadlifts (65lb, 45lb)**

**8 hang power cleans (65lb, 45lb)**

**6 thrusters (65lb, 45lb)**

**4 box jumps to a comfortable height**

**2 partial wall walks**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total number of rounds and repetitions you complete during today’s workout.
