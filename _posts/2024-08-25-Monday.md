[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

It’s Monday, Community Fitness Club! We will start our week with 5 rounds of 10 push-ups, 20 dumbbell box step-ups, and 20 sit-ups. Please try out the dumbbell box step-ups during your warm-up today, and pick a weight that you are confident that you can complete in unbroken sets for at least the first couple of rounds. Have fun out there today! Let’s get this week off to a strong start!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**5 rounds for time:**

**10 push-ups**

**20 dumbbell box step-ups (35lb, 25lb), (24in., 20in.)**

**20 abmat sit-ups**
<!--more-->

Beginners can perform wall push-ups instead of regular push-ups today. They can also modify the sit-ups and reduce the height and weight of the box step-ups. Do what works for you today! A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**5 rounds for time:**

**10 wall push-ups**

**20 dumbbell box step-ups to a comfortable height (10lb, 5lb)**

**10 anchored or assisted sit-ups**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**5 rounds for time:**

**10 kneeling push-ups or box push-ups or 5 regular push-ups**

**20 box step-ups to a comfortable height (25lb, 15lb)**

**15 abmat sit-ups**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
