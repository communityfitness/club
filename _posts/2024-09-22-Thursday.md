[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Today’s WOD is an AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”) in which the goal is to complete as many rounds of 5 burpees, 10 kettlebell deadlifts, 5 box jumps, and 10 calories on the rower as you can during the 15 minute time limit. The kettlebell deadlifts will strengthen your legs and back; the box jumps will increase your explosiveness; and the burpees and the rower will work your whole body while getting you good and sweaty. Combined these four movements will help you become a better overall athlete, so work hard and get it done!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**5 burpees**

**10 kettlebell deadlifts (71lb, 53lb)**

**5 box jumps (24in., 20in.)**

**10 calorie row**
<!--more-->

AMRAPs scale automatically. A beginner will naturally perform fewer reps than an advanced athlete. However, it is often necessary to scale other aspects of the workout as well. Beginners should pick a burpee modification and kettlebell weight that they can perform safely. Also, if you aren’t up for jumping today, consider substituting box step-ups for the box jumps. You can hold on to your kettlebell during these step-ups for added difficulty or perform them with your body weight only. Choose the options that are right for you today! A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**5 elevated, no push-up burpees**

**8 kettlebell deadlifts (20lb, 15lb)**

**5 box jumps or 10 box step-ups to a comfortable height**

**8 calorie row**

Modify today’s workout to your current fitness level. Pick the kettlebell weight and burpee modification that is right for you, and jump to a height that you are comfortable with. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**5 step-back burpees**

**10 kettlebell deadlifts (53lb, 35lb)**

**5 box jumps to a comfortable height**

**10 calorie row**

Your score is the total number of rounds and reps you complete during the 15 minute AMRAP.
