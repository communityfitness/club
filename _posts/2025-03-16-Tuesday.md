Today’s WOD is a 12 minute AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”) where the goal is to complete as many rounds of 1 wall walk, 20 double unders, and 8 dumbbell box step-ups as you can in the 12 minute workout period. The wall walks will work your core and upper body while also challenging your balance; the double unders will improve your cardio and coordination; and the dumbbell box step-ups will work your lower body while also helping to correct any imbalances you might have between your left and right sides. Push hard, and get in as many rounds and reps as you can!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**12 minute AMRAP:**

**1 wall walk**

**20 double unders**

**8 dumbbell box step-ups (35lb, 25lb), (24in., 20in.)**
<!--more-->

Besides moving slower than advanced athletes, beginner athletes can make other modifications as well. They can substitute inchworms for the wall walks and single unders or imaginary jump rope for the double unders. They can also modify the dumbbell box step-ups by using a shorter box and lighter dumbbells. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**12 minute AMRAP:**

**2 inchworms**

**10 single unders or 20 imaginary jump rope**

**8 dumbbell box step-ups to a comfortable height (12lb, 8lb)**

If you’re not ready to perform full wall walks, find a modification that works for you today. Information on how to scale wall walks can be found at the wall walks link at the bottom of this page. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**12 minute AMRAP:**

**1 partial wall walk or box wall walk or 2 inchworm push-ups**

**10 double unders or 40 single unders**

**8 dumbbell box step-ups to a comfortable height (25lb, 15lb)**

Your score is the total number of rounds and reps you complete during today’s workout.
