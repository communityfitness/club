[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

We will end the week with a 15 minute AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”) containing box jumps, kettlebell deadlifts, and bear crawl. Please notice that you are jumping onto a taller box today. This can be a fun challenge, but if your legs aren’t feeling up to it, feel free to jump to a lower box instead. 

It’s always a good idea to scale the workout to how you are feeling on any particular day. So, if you’re feeling tired today, it’s okay to move a little slower and take longer breaks. But if you’re feeling strong, push hard and get in as many rounds and reps as possible! 

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**5 box jumps (30in., 24in.)**

**10 kettlebell deadlifts (71lb, 53lb)**

**100 foot bear crawl**
<!--more-->

Beginners please modify today’s workout as needed. If your body doesn’t want to jump, you can replace the box jumps with box step-ups. If bear crawling for the whole distance isn’t going to happen today, try a shorter distance instead. Like I said on Monday, the goal is to do *something*, not *everything*. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**4 box jumps or box step-ups to a challenging (but safe and doable) height**

**8 kettlebell deadlifts (20lb, 15lb)**

**50 foot bear crawl**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**5 box jumps to a challenging (but safe and doable) height**

**10 kettlebell deadlifts (53lb, 35lb)**

**80 foot bear crawl**

Your score is the total number of rounds and reps you complete during the 15 minute AMRAP.
