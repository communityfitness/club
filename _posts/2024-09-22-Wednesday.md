[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

For today’s workout, you will complete 4 rounds of 5 wall walks, 10 dumbbell push jerks, 20 dumbbell walking lunges, and 40 double unders. This WOD will challenge every part of you: your lower body, your upper body, your core, your cardiovascular system, and your coordination. Scale it to make it right for you, and then get after it!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**4 rounds for time:**

**5 wall walks**

**10 dumbbell push jerks (50lb, 35lb)**

**20 dumbbell walking lunges (50lb, 35lb)**

**40 double unders**
<!--more-->

A beginner can perform inchworms instead of wall walks and single unders or imaginary jump rope instead of double unders. They can also reduce the dumbbell weight, modify the lunges, and scale the rep scheme. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**4 rounds for time:**

**5 inchworms**

**10 dumbbell push jerks (8lb, 5lb) or push presses (5lb, 3lb)**

**14 modified lunges**

**30 single unders or 60 imaginary jump rope**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**4 rounds for time:**

**5 partial wall walks or box wall walks or 2 full wall walks**

**10 dumbbell push jerks (30lb, 20lb)**

**20 dumbbell walking lunges (30lb, 20lb)**

**20 double unders or 80 single unders**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
