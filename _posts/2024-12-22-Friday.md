We’re counting down to the New Year, Community Fitness Club! In today’s workout, we will count down the reps of pull-ups, handstand push-ups, and deadlifts by performing a descending ladder of these movements. We will begin with 10 pull-ups, 10 handstand push-ups, and 10 deadlifts, then perform 9 repetitions of each of these movements, then 8, and so on, until we complete the last round of 1 pull-up, 1 handstand push-up, and 1 deadlift. Please be thoughtful when choosing the weight for your deadlifts. You will be performing 55 repetitions of each movement all together. Go lighter rather than sacrificing your form.

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

***Countdown***

**Experienced:**

**10 - 9 - 8 - 7 - 6 - 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 reps for time:**

**Pull-ups**

**Handstand push-ups**

**Deadlifts (225lb, 155lb)**
<!--more-->

Beginners can substitute ring rows for pull-ups, seated dumbbell presses for handstand push-ups, and kettlebell deadlifts for deadlifts with a barbell. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**10 - 9 - 8 - 7 - 6 - 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 reps for time:**

**Ring rows**

**Seated dumbbell presses (8lb, 5lb)**

**Kettlebell deadlifts (35lb, 22lb)**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**10 - 9 - 8 - 7 - 6 - 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 reps for time:**

**Jumping or banded pull-ups**

**Box handstand push-ups**

**Deadlifts (125lb, 95lb)**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
