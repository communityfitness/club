Today’s WOD consists of 10 rounds of 6/5 calories on the air bike (6 for men, 5 for women), 6 push-ups, 8 dumbbell walking lunges, and 20 double unders. Modify the workout as needed, but remember to challenge yourself where possible as well! 

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**10 rounds for time:**

**6/5 calorie air bike**

**6 push-ups**

**8 dumbbell walking lunges (50lb, 35lb)**

**20 double unders**
<!--more-->

A beginner can make today’s WOD more doable by modifying the movements. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**10 rounds for time:**

**4/3 calorie air bike**

**6 wall push-ups**

**8 modified lunges**

**20 imaginary jump rope or 10 single unders**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**10 rounds for time:**

**5/4 calorie air bike**

**6 kneeling or box push-ups or 3 regular push-ups**

**8 dumbbell walking lunges (35lb, 25lb)**

**10 double unders or 40 single unders**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
