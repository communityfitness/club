[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

For today’s workout, we will complete 4 rounds of 100 double unders, 4 wall walks (or your preferred modification), and 20 sit-ups as quickly as possible. Both the double unders and the wall walks are challenging movements, so make the modifications that are appropriate for you today. Choose  a scaling option for the double unders that you can complete in under 2 minutes per round. It’s okay to reduce the number of repetitions per round, perform a combination of single unders and double unders, or substitute an easier option. The same is true for the wall walks. Push hard, but be smart! You can do it!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**4 rounds for time:**

**100 double unders**

**4 wall walks**

**20 abmat sit-ups**
<!--more-->

Beginners can substitute single unders or imaginary jump rope for the double unders, inchworms for the wall walks, and anchored or assisted sit-ups for the abmat sit-ups. The rep scheme can also be modified as needed. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**4 rounds for time:**

**100 imaginary jump rope or 50 single unders**

**6 inchworms**

**12 anchored or assisted sit-ups**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**4 rounds for time:**

**50 double unders or 200 single unders**

**4 partial wall walks or 2 full wall walks**

**16 abmat sit-ups**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
