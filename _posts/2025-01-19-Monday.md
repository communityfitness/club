It’s Monday again, Community Fitness Club! Let’s kick off the week with a 15 minute AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”). The goal of today’s WOD is to complete as many rounds of 6 pull-ups, 10/8 calories on the air bike, and 10 wall balls as you can in the 15 minute time limit. The first several rounds might feel easy, but these exercises will definitely catch up with you by the end. Just keep working, and do your best!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**6 pull-ups**

**10/8 calorie air bike**

**10 wall balls (20lb, 14lb)**
<!--more-->

Beginners can substitute ring rows for pull-ups and dumbbell thrusters, wall ball goblet squats, or sit-to-stands for wall balls. The rep scheme of the workout can also be modified. Do what works for you! A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**4 ring rows**

**6/4 calorie air bike**

**8 wall balls, dumbbell thrusters (5lb, 3lb), wall ball goblet squats, or sit-to-stands**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**6 jumping or banded pull-ups or 3 regular pull-ups**

**8/6 calorie air bike**

**10 wall balls (14lb, 10lb)**

Your score is the total number of rounds and repetitions you complete during today’s workout.
