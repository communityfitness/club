[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Today’s workout contains the air bike, deadlifts and, of course, your new favorate movement, burpees! Today we will complete 21 deadlifts and 21 bar facing burpees, followed by 15 deadlifts and 15 bar facing burpees, followed by 9 deadlifts and 9 bar facing burpees. We will then finish the workout with 45/37 (45 for men, 37 for women) calories on the air bike.

Please note: though the goal of today’s workout is to move through the WOD as quickly as possible, concentrate on being careful and using good form for your deadlifts and burpees. Please err on the side of caution when choosing which deadlift weight to use, and feel free to step over the bar rather than jump over the bar during the bar facing burpees. Getting through the WOD faster is never worth injuring yourself!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**21-15-9 repetitions for time:**

**Deadlifts (225lb, 155lb)**

**Burpees**

**Buy out: 45/37 calorie air bike**

Beginners can modify both the movements and the rep scheme for today’s workout. Consider performing kettlebell deadlifts instead of barbell deadlifts, and try to move through each set slowly to maintain proper form. Find a burpee modification that works for you. You might also choose to modify the rep scheme, so that you perform smaller sets of each movement at a time. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**11-10-8-7-5-4 repetitions for time:**

**Kettlebell deadlifts (35lb, 22lb)**

**Elevated, no push-up burpees**

**Buy out: 35/29 calorie air bike**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Choose the weight for your deadlift carefully, and pick a burpee modification that you are comfortable with. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**21-15-9 repetitions for time:**

**Deadlifts (135lb, 95lb)**

**Step-back bar facing burpees**

**Buy out: 40/33 calorie air bike**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
