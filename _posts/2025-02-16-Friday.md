TGIF, Community Fitness Club! Let’s wrap up the week with a 15 minute AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”). If you are feeling strong today, push hard and complete as many rounds of 5 air bike calories, 10 up and down planks, 15 Russian twists, and 20 box step-ups as you can. If you are feeling tired, work a little slower, and try to perform each movement more mindfully than usual. Either way, I think you’ll get in an excellent workout!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**5 calorie air bike**

**10 up and down planks**

**15 Russian twists with dumbbell (20lb, 15lb)**

**20 box step-ups (24in., 20in.)**
<!--more-->

Beginners can modify the movements and reps scheme of today’s WOD. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**3 calorie air bike**

**20 second plank hold**

**9 Russian twists (no dumbbell, heels resting lightly on floor)**

**12 box step-ups to a comfortable height**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**4 calorie air bike**

**8 up and down planks**

**12 Russian twists with dumbbell (8lb, 5lb)**

**16 box step-ups to a comfortable height**

Your score is the total number of rounds and repetitions you complete during today’s workout.
