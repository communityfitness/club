It’s Friday the 13th, Community Fitness Club! Let’s mark it with a 13 minute AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”) of deadlifts, bar facing burpees, and sit-ups. The goal is to complete as many rounds of 3 deadlifts, 6 bar facing burpees, and 9 sit-ups as we can in the 13 minutes. 

Please remember, if you’re feeling tired today, it is okay to move a little slower and take longer breaks. However, if you’re feeling strong, push hard and get in as many reps as possible! As always, though, be careful when performing the deadlifts. Pick a weight that you can handle with good form throughout the workout.

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**13 minute AMRAP:**

**3 deadlifts (225lb, 155lb)**

**6 bar facing burpees**

**9 abmat sit-ups**
<!--more-->

If this type of workout is new to you, please modify both the movements and the rep scheme as needed. Consider performing kettlebell deadlifts instead of barbell deadlifts, and try to move through each set slowly to maintain proper form. You can also modify the burpees and sit-ups to make them easier. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**13 minute AMRAP:**

**6 kettlebell deadlifts (35lb, 22lb)**

**6 elevated, no push-up burpees**

**9 anchored or assisted sit-ups**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**13 minute AMRAP:**

**3 deadlifts (155lb, 105lb)**

**6 step-back, bar facing burpees (Can step over the bar instead of jump over)**

**9 abmat sit-ups**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. Your score is the total number of rounds and reps you complete during the 13 minute AMRAP.
