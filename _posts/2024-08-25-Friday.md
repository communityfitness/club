August is almost over, Community Fitness Club! Let’s finish off the month with a “Fight Gone Bad” style workout. In today’s WOD, you will perform one minute of mountain climbers, then move directly into one minute of alternating lunges, then one minute of bear crawl, then one minute of jump rope, then one minute of toes-to-bar, then one minute of rest. You will then repeat this sequence two more times.

To time today’s workout using the SmartWOD timer app:
1. Select “EMOM”.
2. Choose “Every 1 for 17.”
3. Press “START TIMER”.

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**3 rounds in 17 minutes:**

**1 minute of mountain climbers**

**1 minute of alternating lunges**

**1 minute of bear crawl**

**1 minute of double unders**

**1 minute of toes-to-bar**

**1 minute rest**
<!--more-->

Beginners can modify the movements in today’s workout as needed and move slower throughout. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**3 rounds in 17 minutes:**

**1 minute of mountain climbers**

**1 minute of modified lunges**

**1 minute of bear crawl**

**1 minute of single unders or imaginary jump rope**

**1 minute of toes-to-rig**

**1 minute rest**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**3 rounds in 17 minutes:**

**1 minute of mountain climbers**

**1 minute of alternating lunges**

**1 minute of bear crawl**

**1 minute of double unders or single unders**

**1 minute of hanging leg raises**

**1 minute rest**

Your score is the total number of repetitions you complete during today’s workout. Count each meter of bear crawl as one rep.
