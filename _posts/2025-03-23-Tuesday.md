Today’s AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”) features rowing, dumbbell thrusters, and pull-ups. For 20 minutes, you will perform as many rounds of 20 calories on the rower, 10 dumbbell thrusters, and 10 pull-ups as you can. Really focus on your rowing form today. Push hard with your legs, and keep your back flat and your core engaged. Work hard, and get in as many rounds and repetitions as you can!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**20 minute AMRAP:**

**20 calorie row**

**10 dumbbell thrusters (40lb, 30lb)**

**10 pull-ups**
<!--more-->

Beginners can scale today’s WOD by modifying the rep scheme and the movements. If 20 minutes is too long for you today, you can also shorten the workout time. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**16 minute AMRAP:**

**12 calorie row**

**6 dumbbell thrusters (5lb, 3lb) or air squats or sit-to-stands**

**6 ring rows**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**20 minute AMRAP:**

**16 calorie row**

**8 dumbbell thrusters (30lb, 20lb)**

**8 jumping or banded pull-ups or 4 regular pull-ups**

Your score is the total number of rounds and repetitions you complete during today’s workout.
