[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

It’s a beautiful spring week, Community Fitness Club! Let’s kick it off with 5 rounds of 6 pull-ups, 8 burpee box jump overs, and 10 wall ball squat cleans. Try to move quickly, but consider switching to box step-overs if your box jumps don’t feel good today. Let’s make smart decisions, and get this week off to a great start by finishing today’s workout as quickly as we can!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**5 rounds for time:**

**6 pull-ups**

**8 burpee box jump overs (24in., 20in.)**

**10 wall ball squat cleans (20lb, 14lb)**
<!--more-->

Beginners can substitute ring rows for the pull-ups and wall ball goblet squats or sit-to-stands for the wall ball squat cleans in today’s workout. The burpee box jump overs can also be modified by splitting the movement into its two component parts. Just perform modified burpees followed by the box jumps separately. To learn more about modifying burpees, check out the link at the bottom of this post. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**5 rounds for time:**

**4 ring rows**

**6 elevated, no push-up burpees**

**6 box jumps to a comfortable height**

**8 wall ball goblet squats or sit-to-stands**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**5 rounds for time:**

**6 jumping or banded pull-ups or 3 regular pull-ups**

**8 step-back burpee box jump overs to a comfortable height**

**10 wall ball squat cleans (14lb, 10lb)**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
