[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up) 

Welcome to another beautiful autumn Monday, Community Fitness Club! Let’s kick off this week with 5 rounds of 6 handstand push-ups, 8 pull-ups, 15 wall ball squat cleans, and 20 sit-ups. 

Since the number of handstand push-ups performed each round is small, try to challenge yourself by performing a harder variation than normal. If you usually use an abmat to raise your head a little, you might try going flush to the floor today. If you usually perform box handstand push-ups kneeling on the box, you could try standing on the box today instead. If you’re already really good at handstand push-ups, think about trying [deficit handstand push-ups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngexV8j0gV0) today. 

For everything else, pick scaling options that allow you to complete each exercise in 1-2 sets. It’s okay to scale to an easier variation or to reduce the number or repetitions per round. You know your body best. Make smart choices, and have fun out there today!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**5 rounds for time:**

**6 handstand push-ups**

**8 pull-ups**

**15 wall ball squat cleans (20lb, 14lb)**

**20 abmat sit-ups**
<!--more-->

Beginners can substitute seated dumbbell presses for the handstand push-ups. Try to go a little heavier with your dumbbell weight today though, if possible! Beginners can also perform ring rows instead of pull-ups, wall ball goblet squats instead of wall ball squat cleans, anchored or assisted sit-ups instead of abmat sit-ups, and can modify the rep scheme. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**5 rounds for time:**

**6 seated dumbbell presses (12lb, 8lb)**

**4 ring rows**

**10 wall ball goblet squats or sit-to-stands**

**4 ring rows**

**10 anchored or assisted sit-ups**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**5 rounds for time:**

**6 box handstand push-ups**

**8 banded or jumping pull-ups or 4 pull-ups**

**15 wall ball squat cleans (14lb, 10lb)**

**15 abmat sit-ups**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
