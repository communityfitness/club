[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Happy Monday, Community Fitness Club! We’re going to start the week with an eighteen minute AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”) of basic movements: pull-ups, push-ups, sit-ups, and air squats. Today, please focus on completing a full range of motion with each movement. Make sure your chin goes over the bar each time on the pull-ups, and completely straighten your arms when you come down. For the push-ups, lower your chest all the way to the ground on the descent and straighten your arms fully at the top. For the air squats, try to squat past parallel and then open your hips completely at the top. For more information on how to perform and scale these movements, check out the links below. 

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**18 minute AMRAP:**

**8 pull-ups**

**16 push-ups**

**24 abmat sit-ups**

**32 air squats**
<!--more-->

Beginners can modify the movements, rep scheme, and workout time to make today’s workout feel more doable. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**16 minute AMRAP:**

**6 ring rows**

**8 anchored or assisted sit-ups**

**10 wall push-ups**

**12 air squats or sit-to-stands**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**18 minute AMRAP:**

**6 jumping pull-ups or banded pull-ups**

**12 box push-ups or kneeling push-ups**

**18 abmat sit-ups**

**24 air squats**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total number of rounds and repetitions you complete during today’s workout.
