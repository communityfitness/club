[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

In today’s workout, you will complete 5 tabatas. A tabata contains 8 rounds of 20 seconds of work and 10 seconds of rest.

For the first tabata, you will rotate through high plank, low plank, right side plank, and left side plank. For the second tabata, you will alternate between box jumps and push-ups. For the third tabata, you will alternate between high knees and lunges. For the fourth tabata, you will alternate between up and down plank and bear crawl. Finally, for the fifth tabata, you alternate between flutter kicks and Superman hold. There will be one minute of rest between each tabata.
