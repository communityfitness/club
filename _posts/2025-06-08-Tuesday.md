[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Today we will be performing 10 rounds of 3 power cleans, 20 double unders, and 20 walking lunges. If you've been working on your double unders but haven’t felt ready to do them in an actual workout yet, try performing them today. Just reduce the total number per round to something doable for you! As an additional challenge, go a little heavier on your power cleans today. Pick a weight that is challenging for you but that you can still perform safely. If your form starts to get shaky, please drop down to a lighter weight! 

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**10 rounds for time:**

**3 power cleans (135lb, 95lb)**

**20 double unders**

**20 walking lunges**
<!--more-->

Beginners can substitute either single unders or imaginary jump rope for the double unders and can modify the lunges as needed. Dumbbell power cleans can also be done instead of power cleans with a barbell, or a trainer bar could be used for today’s workout. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**8 rounds for time:**

**3 dumbbell power cleans (15lb, 8lb)**

**10 single unders or 20 imaginary jump rope**

**10 modified lunges**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**10 rounds for time:**

**3 power cleans (95lb, 65lb)**

**10 double unders or 40 single unders**

**16 walking lunges**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
