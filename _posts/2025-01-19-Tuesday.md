[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

In today’s workout you will complete 5 rounds of 10 toes-to-bar, 16 dumbbell overhead walking lunges, and 10 burpees, with a 90-second rest between each round. The working portions of today’s WOD are meant to be somewhat fast-paced, so consider doing a test round of each movement during your warm-up. If it takes you more than 45 seconds to complete any set, modify either the movement or the number of repetitions performed. You’ll only get slower as the workout progresses, so pick a scaling option that you can maintain throughout the whole WOD!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**5 rounds for time:**

**10 toes-to-bar**

**16 dumbbell overhead walking lunges (35lb, 25lb)**

**10 burpees**

***Rest 90 seconds***

Beginners can make several modifications to today’s workout to make it more doable. Toes-to-rig can be substituted for toes-to-bar; modified lunges can be substituted for dumbbell walking lunges; and the burpees can be modified. The number of repetitions performed each round can also be scaled. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**5 rounds for time:**

**8 toes-to-rig**

**12 modified lunges**

**8 elevated no push-up burpees**

***Rest 90 seconds***

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**5 rounds for time:**

**10 hanging knee raises**

**14 dumbbell overhead walking lunges (25lb, 15lb) or dumbbell walking lunges (35lb, 25lb)**

**8 step-back burpees**

***Rest 90 seconds***

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
