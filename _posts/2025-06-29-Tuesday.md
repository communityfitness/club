Wow! Can you believe that it’s already July, Community Fitness Club? Let’s kick off the month with a 14 minute AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”). The goal today is to complete as many rounds of 7 pull-ups, 14 wall balls, and 21 sit-ups as you can during the 14 minute workout. Work hard, move fast, and see just how much you can really accomplish!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**14 minute AMRAP:**

**7 pull-ups**

**14 wall balls (20lb, 14lb)**

**21 abmat sit-ups**
<!--more-->

AMRAPs scale automatically. A beginner will naturally perform fewer reps than an advanced athlete. However, it is often necessary to scale other aspects of the workout as well. Ring rows can be substituted for pull-ups, and dumbbell thrusters, air squats, or sit-to-stands can be substituted for wall balls. The sit-ups can be modified as well. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**14 minute AMRAP:**

**5 ring rows**

**8 wall balls (10lb, 10lb), dumbbell thrusters (5lb, 3lb), air squats, or sit-to-stands**

**11 anchored or assisted sit-ups**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**14 minute AMRAP:**

**7 jumping or banded pull-ups or 3 regular pull-ups**

**14 wall balls (14lb, 10lb)**

**21 abmat sit-ups**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total number of rounds and reps you complete during the 14 minute AMRAP.
