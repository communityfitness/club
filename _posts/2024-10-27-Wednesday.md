Today’s WOD will prepare you to carry your child’s (or your own!) Halloween haul by working your grip strength and endurance. “AMRAP” stands for “As Many Reps As Possible.” The goal today is to get as much work done during the 18 minutes as you can. In this workout, you will perform a 100 meter farmer’s carry, 10 dumbbell box step-ups, and 10 push-ups each round. Keep going until all 18 minutes have elapsed. Remember to stand all the way up and fully open your hips at the top of each box step-up!

I don’t expect you to break out a measuring stick for the 100 meter farmers carry! It is okay to approximate the distance. I suggest taking 25 large steps in one direction, marking where you end up, and traveling this distance 4 times each round. 

If you are an experienced athlete, please perform the following WOD:

***Candy Carry***

**Experienced:**

**18 minute AMRAP:**

**100 meter farmers carry (50lb, 35lb)**

**10 dumbbell box step-ups (24in., 20in.) (50lb, 35lb)**

**10 push-ups**
<!--more-->

AMRAPs scale automatically. A beginner will naturally perform fewer reps than an advanced athlete. Even so, 18 minutes might seem overwhelming to a beginner, so please take breaks as needed. A beginner can also scale the dumbbell weights and box heights in today’s WOD.

**Scaled 1:**

**18 minute AMRAP:**

**100 meter farmers carry (15lb, 10lb)**

**10 dumbbell box step-ups to a comfortable height (15lb, 10lb)**

**10 wall push-ups**

Please feel free to scale as needed. Pick a dumbbell weight that you can handle, and don’t be afraid to make adjustments mid-WOD. Another version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**18 minute AMRAP:**

**100 meter farmers carry (30lb, 20lb)**

**10 dumbbell box step-ups to a comfortable height (30lb, 20lb)**

**10 kneeling push-ups or 5 regular push-ups**

Your score is the number of rounds and reps you complete during the 18 minutes.
