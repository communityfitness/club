[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

How’s your new year going so far, Community Fitness Club? Today we will be doing a workout that we’ve performed every new year since January 1, 2020. It is a benchmark workout named *Baseline*. By performing this WOD today, you can see how you have improved and also set a baseline for your 2025 progress.

Remember that improvement can be measured in many ways, not just a faster time. Perhaps you feel more confident than you did when you first began. Perhaps you are able to squat deeper or row with better form. Celebrate your progress in whatever ways you can see it!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

***Baseline***

**Experienced:**

**For time:**

**500m row**

**40 air squats**

**30 abmat sit-ups**

**20 push-ups**

**10 pull-ups**
<!--more-->

If you find yourself feeling overwhelmed after reading this version of the workout, that’s no problem at all! Simply scale the movements and number of repetitions to something more doable for you. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**2 rounds for time:**

**250m row**

**20 air squats or sit-to-stands**

**15 anchored or assisted sit-ups**

**10 wall push-ups**

**5 ring rows**

It is also completely okay to do something in between the experienced version and the beginner version. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**For time:**

**500m row**

**40 air squats**

**30 abmat sit-ups**

**20 kneeling push-ups or box push-ups**

**10 jumping or banded pull-ups**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
