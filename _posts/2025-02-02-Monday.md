Happy Monday, Community Fitness Club! I hope you are enjoying your February so far! Let’s kick this week off by completing a workout consisting of 5 rounds of 9 pull-ups, 24 kettlebell swings, and a 600 meter row. Today’s workout is on the longer side, so if you are strapped for time, feel free to set a time cap and get in as much of the workout as you can. Remember, the goal is to do *something*. You don’t have to do *everything*.

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**5 rounds for time:**

**9 pull-ups**

**24 American kettlebell swings (53lb, 35lb)**

**600 meter row**
<!--more-->

Beginners can scale the rep scheme and modify the movements in today’s workout. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**5 rounds for time:**

**6 ring rows**

**18 Russian kettlebell swings (20lb, 15lb)**

**500 meter row**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**5 rounds for time:**

**9 jumping or banded pull-ups or 5 regular pull-ups**

**24 American kettlebell swings (35lb, 22lb)**

**600 meter row**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
