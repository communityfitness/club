[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

For today’s workout, we will complete 3 rounds of 12 pull-ups, 20 dumbbell box step-ups, and 80 double unders as quickly as possible. For a lot of us, performing 80 double unders in a row is quite difficult, so pick a scaling option that challenges you without being overly frustrating. Shoot for a jump rope option that you can complete in 2 minutes or less each round. The dumbbell box step-ups are also meant to be challenging today. It’s okay to take a short break as you work through each set of 20!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD: 

**Experienced:**

**3 rounds for time:**

**12 pull-ups**

**20 dumbbell box step-ups (24in., 20in.), (50lb, 35lb)**

**80 double unders**
<!--more-->

Both the movements and the rep scheme can be scaled in today’s workout. Ring rows can be substituted for pull-ups, the dumbbell box step-ups can be modified, and single unders or imaginary jump rope can replace the double unders. You know your body best. Do what’s right for you! A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**3 rounds for time:**

**5 ring rows**

**20 dumbbell box step-ups to a comfortable height (12lb, 8lb)**

**5 ring rows**

**80 imaginary jump rope or 40 single unders**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**3 rounds for time:**

**12 jumping or banded pull-ups or 6 regular pull-ups**

**20 dumbbell box step-ups to a comfortable height (30lb, 20lb)**

**40 double unders or 160 single unders**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
