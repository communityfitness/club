We will end the week with a 14 minute AMRAP containing rounds of 5 pull-ups, 10 deadlifts, and 15 squat jumps. If you’re feeling tired after a long week of working out, feel free to move a little slower and take longer breaks. If you’re feeling strong, push hard and get in as many rounds and reps as possible! 

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**14 minute AMRAP:**

**5 pull-ups**

**10 deadlifts (125lb, 95lb)**

**15 squat jumps**
<!--more-->

AMRAPs scale automatically. A beginner will naturally perform fewer reps than an advanced athlete. However, it is often necessary to scale other aspects of the workout as well. Beginners can substitute ring rows for pull-ups, kettlebell deadlifts for deadlifts with a barbell, and half squats with a small hop for squat jumps. The rep scheme can also be scaled. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**14 minute AMRAP:**

**4 ring rows**

**8 kettlebell deadlifts (20lb, 15lb)**

**12 half squats with a hop**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**14 minute AMRAP:**

**5 jumping or banded pull-ups**

**10 deadlifts (95lb, 65lb)**

**15 squat jumps**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total number of rounds and reps you complete during today’s workout.

Welcome to a brand new week, Community Fitness Club! We’ll kick off the last full week of March with a workout containing a descending ladder of double unders and an ascending ladder of kettlebell swings.
