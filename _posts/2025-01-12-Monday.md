It’s Monday, Community Fitness Club! Today’s WOD (“Workout of the Day”) is a quick one, so really push hard and get in as many rounds and repetitions as possible. For 10 minutes, you will perform as many rounds of 10 kettlebell swings, 20 double unders, and 5 thrusters as you can. Try to pick modifications where you are able to finish each movement unbroken throughout the whole workout. If you’re needing to break up your sets, please consider switching to an easier scaling option. The goal is to keep working continuously from the beginning of the workout to the end.

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**10 minute AMRAP:**

**10 American kettlebell swings (53lb, 35lb)**

**20 double unders**

**5 thrusters (95lb, 65lb)**
<!--more-->

Beginners can modify today’s workout to their current fitness abilities by altering the rep scheme and scaling the movements. You can replace the American kettlebell swings with Russian kettlebell swings, the double unders with single unders or imaginary jump rope, and the barbell thrusters with dumbbell thrusters, air squats, or sit-to-stands. Pick the movements that work best for you today and allow you to keep moving! A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**10 minute AMRAP:**

**8 Russian kettlebell swings (20lb, 15lb)**

**10 single unders or 20 imaginary jump rope**

**4 dumbbell thrusters (5lb, 3lb), air squats, or sit-to-stands**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**10 minute AMRAP:**

**10 American kettlebell swings (35lb, 22lb)**

**10 double unders or 40 single unders**

**5 thrusters (45lb, 35lb)**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total number of rounds and repetitions you complete in today’s workout.
