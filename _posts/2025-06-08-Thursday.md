[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Today we will do a tabata-style workout that proves that holding still can be hard work! In a tabata, you perform a given movement for 8 rounds of 20 seconds of work and 10 seconds of rest.

In the first tabata of today’s WOD, you will cycle through each scale variation twice. That is, you will perform a front scale on your left foot for 20 seconds, then a front scale on your right foot for 20 seconds, then a back scale on your left foot for 20 seconds, then a back scale on your right foot for 20 seconds. You will then repeat all four movements one more time.

In the second tabata, you will cycle through plank variations. So, you will perform a high plank for 20 seconds, then a low plank for 20 seconds, then a left side plank for 20 seconds, then a right side plank for 20 seconds. Then you will repeat these four movements one more time.

Then for the 3rd, 4th, and 5th tabatas, you will cycle through 20 seconds of Superman hold, 20 seconds of dead hang, 20 seconds of wall-sit, and 20 seconds of handstand hold. You won’t be moving around much today, but by the end of the workout your muscles will definitely feel the exertion!

To time today’s workout using the SmartWOD timer app, use the following steps:

1. Press “TABATA”.
2. Choose 8 rounds of 0:20 work and 0:10 rest.
3. Press the plus sign beside “Add sets (optional)”.
4. Choose 5 sets and 1:00 rest.
