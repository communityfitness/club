Today’s WOD (“Workout of the Day”)  will begin with a tabata of scales followed by an 18 minute AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”). For the tabata, you will cycle through each scale variation twice. That is, you will perform a front scale on your left foot for 20 seconds, then a front scale on your right foot for 20 seconds, then a back scale on your left foot for 20 seconds, then a back scale on your right foot for 20 seconds. You will then repeat all four movements one more time. 

To time the tabata using the SmartWOD timer app:

(1) Press “TABATA”. 

(2) Select 8 rounds of 0:20 of work, 0:10 of rest. 

(3) Press "START TIMER".

Once you are finished with the tabata, rest, and then continue on to today’s main workout. Try to complete as many rounds of a 400 meter row, 10 dumbbell walking lunges, 8 push-ups, and 6 up and down planks as you can in the 18 minute workout period. Work hard, and get in as many rounds as you can!

**Everyone perform:**

**Tabata - Scales (front left, front right, back left, back right)**

**_Rest _**

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**18 minute AMRAP:**

**400 meter row**

**10 dumbbell walking lunges (50lb, 35lb)**

**8 push-ups**

**6 up and down planks**

A beginner will naturally perform fewer reps than an advanced athlete. However, it might also be necessary to modify some of the movements. Feel free to modify your lunges by using a chair, the rig, or the wall to help with balance. You can also take smaller steps or not lower your back knee all the way to the ground. Wall push-ups can be substituted for regular push-ups, and a plank hold can be substituted for the up and down planks if needed. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**18 minute AMRAP:**

**400 meter row**

**10 modified lunges**

**8 wall push-ups**

**3 up and down planks or 20 second plank hold**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**18 minute AMRAP:**

**400 meter row**

**10 dumbbell walking lunges (30lb, 20lb)**

**8 kneeling or box push-ups or 4 regular push-ups**

**6 up and down planks**
