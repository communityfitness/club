Today’s WOD is short and sweet. It is a quick 10 rounds of 4 air bike calories, 3 dumbbell power cleans, 2 dumbbell box step-ups, and 1 wall walk. Pick scaling options that allow you to move quickly. Ideally, your first several rounds should only take around a minute to complete. Work hard, move fast, and get it done!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**10 rounds for time:**

**4 calorie air bike**

**3 dumbbell power cleans (50lb, 35lb)**

**2 dumbbell box step-ups (24in., 20in.), (50lb, 35lb)**

**1 wall walk**
<!--more-->

Beginners can reduce the weight of the dumbbells and the height of the box step-ups. They can also substitute inchworms for the wall walks. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**10 rounds for time:**

**3 calorie air bike**

**3 dumbbell power cleans (8lb, 5lb)**

**2 dumbbell box step-ups to a comfortable height (8lb, 5lb)**

**1 inchworm**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**10 rounds for time:**

**4 calorie air bike**

**3 dumbbell power cleans (35lb, 25lb)**

**2 dumbbell box step-ups to a comfortable height (35lb, 25lb)**

**1 partial wall walk**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
