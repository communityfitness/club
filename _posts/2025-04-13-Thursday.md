Today’s WOD contains 4 rounds of box jumps, air bike, lunges, and push-ups. Push hard, but be careful on the box jumps! A faster time is never worth an injury!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**4 rounds for time:**

**15/12 calorie air bike**

**5 box jumps (24in., 20in.)**

**20 alternating lunges**

**5 box jumps**

**10 push-ups**

**5 box jumps**
<!--more-->

Beginners can modify both the movements and the number of repetitions in today’s WOD. Do what’s right for you! A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**4 rounds for time:**

**10/8 calorie air bike**

**5 box jumps or 6 box step-ups to a comfortable height**

**12 modified lunges**

**5 box jumps or 6 box step-ups**

**10 wall push-ups**

**5 box jumps or 6 box step-ups**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**4 rounds for time:**

**12/10 calorie air bike**

**5 box jumps to a comfortable height**

**20 alternating lunges**

**5 box jumps**

**10 kneeling or box push-ups or 5 regular push-ups**

**5 box jumps**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
