Happy Friday the 13th, Community Fitness Club! In honor of the date, let’s end this week with a fun 13 minute AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”) in which we will perform as many rounds of 6 power cleans and 1 wall walk as we can in 13 minutes. If you’re feeling tired after a long week of working out, feel free to move little slower today and take more breaks. If you’re feeling good, though, push hard and get in as many rounds and reps as possible!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**13 minute AMRAP:**

**6 power cleans (95lb, 65lb)**

**1 wall walk**
<!--more-->

AMRAPs scale automatically, since beginners will naturally perform fewer reps than advanced athletes. However, it is often necessary to scale other aspects of the workout as well. In today’s workout, dumbbell power cleans can be substituted for the barbell power cleans and inchworms can be substituted for the wall walks. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**13 minute AMRAP:**

**6 dumbbell power cleans (8lb, 5lb)**

**2 inchworms**

Please modify today’s workout to your current fitness level. Pick the power clean weight and wall walk modification that is right for you. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**13 minute AMRAP:**

**6 power cleans (65lb, 45lb)**

**1 partial wall walk or 3 inchworm push-ups**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total number of rounds and reps you complete during the 13 minute AMRAP.
