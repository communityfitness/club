[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Today’s workout is an EMOM which means “Every Minute on the Minute.” We will complete 12/10 calories on the air bike during the first minute, 15 up and down planks during the second minute, 40 mountain climbers during the third minute, and a 40 second hollow body hold during the fourth minute. This will continue for 5 rounds until the 20 minutes are up. Be smart when picking your scaling options today. Try to pick options that you can maintain through the whole workout!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**20 minute EMOM:**

**Minute 1: 12/10 calorie air bike**

**Minute 2: 15 up and down planks**

**Minute 3: 40 mountain climbers**

**Minute 4: 40 seconds of hollow body hold**
<!--more-->

Beginners can scale both the rep scheme and the individual movements. Do what works for you! A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**16 minute EMOM:**

**Minute 1: 6/4 calorie air bike**

**Minute 2: 30 second plank hold (broken as needed)**

**Minute 3: 20 mountain climbers**

**Minute 4: 20 seconds of hollow body hold (broken as needed)**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**20 minute EMOM:**

**Minute 1: 9/7 calorie air bike**

**Minute 2: 12 up and down planks**

**Minute 3: 30 mountain climbers**

**Minute 4: 30 seconds of hollow body hold (broken as needed)**

Your score is the total number of air bike calories you accumulate in today’s workout.
