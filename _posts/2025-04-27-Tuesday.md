It’s Tabata Tuesday, Community Fitness Club! Tabatas are a fun and simple workout format. In a tabata, you perform a given movement for 8 rounds of 20 seconds of work and 10 seconds of rest. 

In the first tabata of today’s WOD, you will cycle through each scale variation twice. That is, you will perform a front scale on your left foot for 20 seconds, then a front scale on your right foot for 20 seconds, then a back scale on your left foot for 20 seconds, then a back scale on your right foot for 20 seconds. You will then repeat all four movements one more time. 

In the next 4 tabatas, you will cycle through jumping rope, kettlebell swings, high knees, and bear crawl. In other words, you will perform 20 seconds of jumping rope, followed by 20 seconds of kettlebell swings, followed by 20 seconds of high knees, followed by 20 seconds bear crawl, then 20 more seconds of jumping rope, followed by 20 more seconds of kettlebell swings, followed by 20 more seconds of high knees, followed by 20 more seconds of bear crawl. You will rest 1 minute between each tabata.

We are not all experienced athletes. That’s okay! Modify the movements, take breaks, and slow down as needed. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**Tabata 1 - Scales (front left, front right, back left, back right)**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 2 - Rotate between single unders or imaginary jump rope, Russian kettlebell swings (20lb, 15lb), march-in-place, and bear crawl**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 3 - Rotate between single unders or imaginary jump rope, Russian kettlebell swings (20lb, 15lb), march-in-place, and bear crawl**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 4 - Rotate between single unders or imaginary jump rope, Russian kettlebell swings (20lb, 15lb), march-in-place, and bear crawl**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 5 - Rotate between single unders or imaginary jump rope, Russian kettlebell swings (20lb, 15lb), march-in-place, and bear crawl**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**Tabata 1 - Scales (front left, front right, back left, back right)**
