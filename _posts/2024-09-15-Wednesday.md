The first two workouts of this week have been on the longer side. Let’s mark the middle of the week with a shorter workout consisting of dumbbell walking lunges and push-ups. Push yourself to complete the movements in unbroken sets if possible. It’s a short one, so move fast and get it done!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**3 rounds for time:**

**16 dumbbell walking lunges (35lb, 25lb)**

**14 push-ups**

**12 dumbbell walking lunges**

**10 push-ups**

**8 dumbbell walking lunges**

**6 push-ups**
<!--more-->

For today’s WOD, beginners can modify the lunges by taking smaller steps, not lowering the back knee as close to the ground, or by using the wall or rig for help stabilizing. Wall push-ups can be substituted for regular push-ups, and the rep scheme can also be adjusted to make the workout more doable. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**3 rounds for time:**

**14 modified lunges**

**12 wall push-ups**

**10 modified lunges**

**8 wall push-ups**

**6 modified lunges**

**4 wall push-ups**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**3 rounds for time:**

**16 dumbbell walking lunges (25lb, 15lb)**

**14 kneeling or box push-ups**

**12 dumbbell walking lunges**

**10 kneeling or box push-ups**

**8 dumbbell walking lunges**

**6 kneeling or box push-ups**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
