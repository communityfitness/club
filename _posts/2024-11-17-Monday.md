It’s Monday again, Community Fitness Club, and today’s workout will definitely kick the week off right! Today you will complete 5 calories on the air bike, 5 sit-ups, and 5 burpees; then 10 calories on the air bike, 10 sit-ups, and 10 burpees; then 15 calories on the air bike, 15 sit-ups, and 15 burpees; then 20 calories on the air bike, 20 sit-ups, and 20 burpees; then another 15 calories on the air bike, 15 sit-ups, and 15 burpees; another 10 calories on the air bike, 10 sit-ups, and 10 burpees; and then a final 5 calories on the air bike, 5 sit-ups, and 5 burpees.

This is a tough workout, so be thoughtful when choosing your scaling options. Pick a burpee modification that works for you. You can also scale the rep scheme to make today’s WOD more doable!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**5-10-15-20-15-10-5 repetitions for time:**

**Air bike calories**

**Abmat sit-ups**

**Burpees**
<!--more-->

If this type of workout is new to you, you can modify the sit-ups and the burpees and also reduce the total number of repetitions. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**3-6-9-12-9-6-3 repetitions for time:**

**Air bike calories**

**Anchored or assisted sit-ups**

**Elevated, no push-up burpees**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**4-8-12-16-12-8-4 repetitions for time:**

**Air bike calories**

**Abmat sit-ups**

**Step-back burpees**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
