[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

For today’s WOD you will complete 30 box jumps, 10 handstand push-ups, 30 double unders, and 30 abmat sit-ups. Then you will complete 20 box jumps, 10 handstand push-ups, 30 double unders, and 20 abmat sit-ups. You will then end the workout with 10 box jumps, 10 handstand push-ups, 30 double unders, and 10 abmat sit-ups. Though your goal is to complete the workout as quickly as possible, please be careful when performing the box jumps. No workout is worth getting injured for!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**For time:**

**30 box jumps (24in., 20in.)**

**10 handstand push-ups**

**30 double unders**

**10 handstand push-ups**

**30 double unders**

**20 abmat sit-ups**

<!--more-->

If this type of workout is new to you, please modify the movements as needed. Jump only to a height you feel comfortable with, or replace the box jumps with box step-ups. Perform seated dumbbell presses instead of handstand push-ups and single unders or imaginary jump rope instead of double unders. Do what works for you! A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**For time:**

**30 box jumps or box step-ups to a comfortable height**

**10 seated dumbbell presses (8lb, 5lb)**

**15 single unders or 30 imaginary jump rope**

**15 anchored or assisted sit-ups**

**20 box jumps or box step-ups**

**10 seated dumbbell presses**

**15 single unders or 30 imaginary jump rope**

**10 anchored or assisted sit-ups**

**10 box jumps or box step-ups**

**10 seated dumbbell presses**

**15 single unders or 30 imaginary jump rope**

**5 anchored or assisted sit-ups**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**For time:**

**30 box jumps to a comfortable height**

**10 box handstand push-ups**

**15 double unders or 60 single unders**

**30 abmat sit-ups**

**20 box jumps**

**10 box handstand push-ups**

**15 double unders or 60 single unders**

**20 abmat sit-ups**

**10 box jumps**

**10 box handstand push-ups**

**15 double unders or 60 single unders**

**10 abmat sit-ups**
