[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Today’s workout is similar to a tabata. We will perform 10 rounds of 20 seconds of burpees, 20 seconds of sit-ups, 20 seconds of pull-ups, and 20 seconds of lunges with 10 seconds of rest between each movement. The goal is to perform as many repetitions of each of the four movements as you can. 

To time today’s workout using the SmartWOD timer app, simply select “TABATA,” then choose 40 rounds of 0:20 work, 0:10 rest. 

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**10 rounds for total reps:**

**20 seconds of burpees**

**10 seconds of rest**

**20 seconds of abmat sit-ups**

**10 seconds of rest**

**20 seconds of pull-ups**

**10 seconds of rest**

**20 seconds of alternating lunges**

**10 seconds of rest**

Like a normal tabata, today’s WOD scales automatically. A beginner will naturally perform fewer reps than an advanced athlete. However, it may also be necessary to scale other aspects of the workout. Beginners can modify the burpees, substitute anchored or assisted sit-ups for abmat sit-ups, ring rows for pull-ups, and modified lunges for regular lunges. A beginner can also reduce the total number of rounds in the workout and increase the rest time between movements. (If you choose to perform 8 rounds instead of 10, select 32 rounds of 0:20 work, 0:15 rest.) A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**8 rounds for total reps:**

**20 seconds of elevated, no push-up burpees**

**15 seconds of rest**

**20 seconds of anchored or assisted sit-ups**

**15 seconds of rest**

**20 seconds of ring rows**

**15 seconds of rest**

**20 seconds of modified lunges**

**15 seconds of rest**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**10 rounds for total reps:**

**20 seconds of step-back burpees**

**10 seconds of rest**

**20 seconds of abmat sit-ups**

**10 seconds of rest**

**20 seconds of jumping or banded pull-ups**

**10 seconds of rest**

**20 seconds of alternating lunges**

**10 seconds of rest**

Your score is the total number of repetitions you complete during today’s workout.
