[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Today we will be performing a WOD (“Workout of the Day”) consisting of burpees, rowing, and box jumps. We will kick off the workout with 10 burpees and a 40 calorie row, followed by another 10 burpees and 30 box jumps. Then we will do another 10 burpees and a 20 calorie row, followed by 10 more burpees and 10 box jumps. Finally, we will finish with the last 10 burpees. As always, personalize today’s workout to your current fitness level today. You know your body best! Pick the scaling options that are right for you!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**For time:**

**10 burpees**

**40 calorie row**

**10 burpees**

**30 box jumps (24in., 20in.)**

**10 burpees**

<!--more-->

If you are new to this type of workout, please scale both the movements and the number of repetitions to your current fitness level. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**For time:**

**10 elevated, no push-up burpees**

**25 calorie row**

**10 elevated, no push-up burpees**

**20 box jumps or box step-ups to a comfortable height**

**10 elevated, no push-up burpees**

**15 calorie row**

**10 elevated, no push-up burpees**

**10 box jumps or box step-ups to a comfortable height**

**10 elevated, no push-up burpees**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**For time:**

**8 step-back burpees**

**40 calorie row**

**8 step-back burpees**

**30 box jumps to a comfortable height**

**8 step-back burpees**

**20 calorie row**

**8 step-back burpees**

**10 box jumps to a comfortable height**

**8 step-back burpees**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s WOD.
