[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Today’s WOD (“Workout of the Day”) is a tabata-style workout. In a tabata, you perform a given movement for eight rounds of 20 seconds of work and 10 seconds of rest.  In the first tabata of today’s WOD, you will cycle through each scale variation twice. That is, you will perform a front scale on your left foot for 20 seconds, then a front scale on your right foot for 20 seconds, then a back scale on your left foot for 20 seconds, then a back scale on your right foot for 20 seconds. You will then repeat all four movements one more time. 

For the second and fourth tabata, you will alternate between performing 20 seconds of dumbbell deadlifts and 20 seconds of dumbbell push jerks. For the third and fifth tabata, you will alternate between performing 20 seconds of high knees and 20 seconds of butt kicks. You will rest 1 minute between each tabata.

To time today’s workout using the SmartWOD timer app: 

1. Select “TABATA”. 
2. Choose 8 rounds of 0:20 work, 0:10 rest. 
3. Press the plus sign beside “Add sets (optional)”.
4. Select 5 sets with 1 minute of rest between sets. 
5. Press “START TIMER”.

You can also use “tabata songs” on YouTube to time your workout.

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Tabata 1 - Scales (Cycle between left leg front scale, right leg front scale, left leg back scale, and right leg back scale.)**

Tabatas scale automatically. A beginner will naturally perform fewer reps than an advanced athlete. However, it may also be necessary to scale some of the movements. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**Tabata 1 - Scales (Cycle between left leg front scale, right leg front, left leg back scale, and right leg back scale.)**

**_Rest 1 minute_**

**Tabata 2 - Alternate between:**

**Dumbbell deadlifts (12lb, 8lb)**

**Dumbbell push jerks (12lb, 8lb) or dumbbell push presses (8lb, 5lb)**

**_Rest 1 minute_**

**Tabata 3 - Alternate between:**

**March in place**

**Butt kicks**

**_Rest 1 minute_**

**Tabata 4 - Alternate between:**

**Dumbbell deadlifts (12lb, 8lb)**

**Dumbbell push jerks (12lb, 8lb) or dumbbell push presses (8lb, 5lb)**

**_Rest 1 minute_**

**Tabata 5 - Alternate between:**

**March in place**

**Butt kicks**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:
