Today’s WOD (“Workout of the Day”) is a 15 minute AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”). Your goal is to complete as many rounds of 20 dumbbell walking lunges, 10 push-ups, and 5 pull-ups as you can during the 18 minute time limit. Try to pick push-up and pull-up modifications that you can keep up throughout the whole workout. Push hard! I know that you can do it!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**20 dumbbell walking lunges (35lb, 25lb)**

**10 push-ups**

**5 pull-ups**
<!--more-->

Beginning athletes can scale today’s WOD by modifying the rep scheme and the movements. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**12 modified lunges**

**6 wall push-ups**

**3 ring rows**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**16 dumbbell walking lunges (25lb, 15lb)**

**8 box or kneeling push-ups**

**4 jumping or banded pull-ups or 2 regular pull-ups**

Your score is the total number of rounds and reps you complete during the 15 minute AMRAP.
