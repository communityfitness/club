If this type of workout is new to you, please feel free to modify both the movements and the rep scheme. You can substitute ring rows for pull-ups and kettlebell deadlifts for barbell deadlifts. You can also pick whichever burpee modification works best for you today. You know your body best! Do what’s right for you today! A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**
