Happy Monday, Community Fitness Club! We will begin our week with a WOD (“Workout of the Day”) that consists of four three-minute work intervals separated by three-minute rest intervals. During the work periods you will perform the given number of burpees and calorie row, and then you will complete as many thrusters as you can before the three-minute interval is up. You will then rest three minutes before starting the next round. The rest periods in today’s workout are generous, so really push hard during the work periods. You might surprise yourself with just how much you can accomplish!

To time today’s workout using the SmartWod timer app, follow these steps:

(1) Press “TABATA”.

(2) Select 4 rounds of 3:00 work and 3:00 rest.

(3) Press “START TIMER.”

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:
