[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Today’s workout will begin by practicing inversions using a tabata format. In a tabata, you perform a given movement for eight rounds of 20 seconds of work and 10 seconds of rest. Pick an inversion modification that works for you today. This could be a handstand against the wall for more experienced athletes or a downward-facing dog stretch for beginning athletes. Check out the inversions link at the bottom of this post for more information on inversion modifications.

To time today’s inversion practice using the SmartWOD timer app: 

1. Select “TABATA”. 
2. Choose 8 rounds of 0:20 work, 0:10 rest.
3. Press “START TIMER”.

**Everyone perform:**

**Tabata - handstands or other inversion modification**

After the tabata, rest as needed, then continue on to today’s main workout, a 16 minute EMOM (“Every Minute on the Minute”) in which you will perform 50 seconds of max calories on the rower in the first minute then 15 sit-ups in the second minute. This will continue for 8 rounds until the 16 minutes are complete. 

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**16 minute EMOM:**

**MInute 1: 50 seconds of max calorie row**

**Minute 2: 15 abmat sit-ups**
<!--more-->

Feel free to scale the sit-ups in today’s workout. Just do what you can, and that will be enough! A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**16 minute EMOM:**

**MInute 1: 50 seconds of max calorie row**

**Minute 2: 8 assisted or anchored sit-ups**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**16 minute EMOM:**

**MInute 1: 50 seconds of max calorie row**

**Minute 2: 12 abmat sit-ups**

Your score is the total number of calories you row during today’s workout.
