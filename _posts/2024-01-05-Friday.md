It’s finally Friday, Community Fitness Club! Let’s end the week with a 16 minute AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”) consisting of rounds of 8 toes-to-bar, 4 power cleans, and 2 wall walks. Please note that the power cleans are heavier than usual today. Pick a weight that is challenging, but that you can still perform with good form. Also, though we are trying to move quickly and complete as many rounds as we can, be careful on the wall walks. Rest or modify the movement as needed. Have fun, be safe, and enjoy your weekend!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**16 minute AMRAP:**

**8 toes-to-bar**

**4 power cleans (135lb, 95lb)**

**2 wall walk**
<!--more-->

Beginners can modify the movements to make today’s WOD more doable. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**16 minute AMRAP:**

**8 toes-to-rig**

**4 dumbbell power cleans (12lb, 8lb)**

**2 inchworms**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**16 minute AMRAP:**

**8 hanging leg raises**

**4 power cleans (95lb, 65lb)**

**2 partial wall walks**

Your score is the total number of rounds and repetitions you complete during today’s workout.
