[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

We will end the week with a 14 minute AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”) of air bike calories, dumbbell overhead walking lunges, and push-ups. The goal is to complete as many rounds of 8/6 calories on the air bike (8 calories for men, 6 calories for women), 8 dumbbell overhead walking lunges, and 6 push-ups as you can. However, if you’re feeling tired, it is okay to move a little slower and take longer breaks. If you’re feeling strong, though, push hard and get in as many reps as possible! 

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**14 minute AMRAP:**

**8/6 calorie air bike**

**8 dumbbell overhead walking lunges (35lb, 25lb)**

**6 push-ups**

AMRAPs scale automatically. A beginner will naturally perform fewer reps than an advanced athlete. However, beginners can scale other aspects of the workout as well. Make the changes you need to in order to make the workout right for you. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**14 minute AMRAP:**

**6/5 calorie air bike**

**6 modified lunges**

**5 wall push-ups**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**14 minute AMRAP:**

**8/6 calorie air bike**

**8 dumbbell overhead walking lunges (15lb, 10lb) or dumbbell walking lunges (35lb, 25lb)**

**6 kneeling push-ups or box push-ups**

Your score is the total number of rounds and reps you complete during the 14-minute AMRAP.
