[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up) 

Today’s workout is an EMOM which stands for “Every Minute on the Minute.” In this workout, you will perform as many dumbbell box step-ups as possible in the first minute, as many sit-ups as possible in the second minute, as many dumbbell push presses as possible in the third minute, as many calories on the air bike as possible in the fourth minute, and then you will rest for the fifth minute. This will continue for 4 rounds until the 20 minutes are up. Try to maintain a fairly consistent number of repetitions for each movement each round.

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**20 minute EMOM:**

**Minute 1: max effort dumbbell box step-ups (35lb, 25lb), (24in., 20in.)**

**Minute 2: max effort abmat sit-ups**

**MInute 3: max effort dumbbell push presses (35lb, 25lb)**

**Minute 4: max effort air bike calories**

**Minute 5: rest**

Beginners can scale today’s WOD by using a shorter box and lighter dumbbells and by modifying the sit-ups. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**20 minute EMOM:**

**Minute 1: max effort dumbbell box step-ups to a comfortable height (15lb, 10lb)**

**Minute 2: max effort anchored or assisted sit-ups**

**Minute 3: max effort dumbbell push presses (8lb, 5lb)**

**Minute 4: max effort air bike calories**

**Minute 5: rest**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**20 minute EMOM:**

**Minute 1: max effort dumbbell box step-ups to a comfortable height (25lb, 15lb)**

**Minute 2: max effort abmat sit-ups**

**MInute 3: max effort dumbbell push presses (25lb, 15lb)**

**Minute 4: max effort air bike calories**

**Minute 5: rest**
