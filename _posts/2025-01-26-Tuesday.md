[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Today’s WOD (“Workout of the Day”) not only contains burpees, but it has a lot of other movements to keep you entertained as well. You will begin today’s workout with a 500 meter row, then move on to 40 kettlebell swings, 30 burpees, 20 toes-to-bar, and 10 handstand push-ups, and then finish with another 500 meter row. This is not a workout to be sprinted through. Try to maintain a steady pace throughout, take breaks as needed, and just get through it!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**For time:**

**500 meter row**

**40 American kettlebell swings (53lb, 35lb)**

**30 burpees**

**20 toes-to-bar**

**10 handstand push-ups**

**500 meter row**
<!--more-->

As always, please feel free to modify the rep scheme and movements as needed. Today, you can reduce the rowing distance and divide the body of the workout into two rounds. You can also substitute Russian kettlebell swings for American kettlebell swings, toes-to-rig for toes-to-bar, and seated dumbbell presses for handstand push-ups. There are many ways to modify burpees as well. Check out the link at the bottom of this page for more ideas! A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**For time:**

**300 meter row, then:**

**2 rounds:**

**20 Russian kettlebell swings (20lb, 15lb)**

**15 elevated, no push-up burpees**

**10 toes-to-rig**

**5 seated dumbbell presses (5lb, 3lb)**

**Then, 300 meter row**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**For time:**

**500 meter row**

**40 American kettlebell swings (35lb, 22lb)**

**30 step-back burpees**

**20 hanging leg raises**

**10 box handstand push-ups**

**500 meter row**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
