Today’s WOD is a 20 minute EMOM (“Every Minute On the Minute”) in which you will perform 12 up and down planks the first minute, a 40 second Superman hold the second minute, 8 inchworms the third minute, 30 Russian twists the fourth minute, and a 40 second wall sit the fifth minute. This will continue for 4 rounds until the 20 minutes are up. If you finish a given movement before the minute is up, rest and wait until the next minute to begin the next movement.

To time today’s WOD using the SmartWOD timer app:

1. Press “EMOM”.
2. Select “Every 1 for 20”.
3. Press “START TIMER”.

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**20 minute EMOM:**

**Minute 1: 12 up and down planks**

**Minute 2: 40 second Superman hold (unbroken)**

**Minute 3: 8 inchworms**

**Minute 4: 30 Russian twists with a dumbbell (20lb, 15lb)**

**Minute 5: 40 second wall sit (unbroken)**
<!--more-->

Beginners can scale both the rep scheme and the movements in today’s workout. Pick the options that are right for you! A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**20 minute EMOM:**

**Minute 1: 30 second plank hold (broken up as needed)**

**Minute 2: 30 second Superman hold (broken up as needed)**

**Minute 3: 4 inchworms**

**Minute 4: 20 Russian twists (heels resting on floor if needed)**

**Minute 5: 30 second wall sit (broken up as needed)**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**20 minute EMOM:**

**Minute 1: 10 up and down planks**

**Minute 2: 30 second Superman hold (unbroken)**

**Minute 3: 6 inchworms**

**Minute 4: 30 Russian twists**

**Minute 5: 30 second wall sit (unbroken)**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.
