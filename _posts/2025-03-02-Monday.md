[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up) 

We will begin the week with a descending ladder of rowing for calories, wall ball squat cleans, and wall walks. Though the goal is to finish as quickly as possible, don’t try to sprint through today’s workout. Instead go at a moderate pace that keeps your heart rate controlled and your progress steady. If today’s WOD feels like too much for you, feel free to shorten it. Some workout is better than no workout!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**For time:**

**40 calorie row**

**40 wall ball squat cleans (20lb, 14lb)**

**4 wall walks**

**30 calorie row**

**30 wall ball squat cleans (20lb, 14lb)**

**3 wall walks**

**20 calorie row**

**20 wall ball squat cleans (20lb, 14lb)**

**2 wall walks**

**10 calorie row**

**10 wall ball squat cleans (20lb, 14lb)**

**1 wall walk**
<!--more-->

Beginners should feel free to shorten today’s workout as needed. The wall ball squat cleans and wall walks can also be modified. If you don’t feel comfortable performing wall ball squat cleans, consider performing goblet squats, air squats, or sit-to-stands instead. Inchworms can also be substituted for the wall walks. Pick the scaling options that work for you today! A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**For time:**

**30 calorie row**

**30 wall ball goblet squats, air squats, or sit-to-stands**

**6 inchworms**

**20 calorie row**

**20 wall ball goblet squats, air squats, or sit-to-stands**

**4 inchworms**

**10 calorie row**

**10 wall ball goblet squats, air squats, or sit-to-stands**

**2 inchworms**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**35 calorie row**

**35 wall ball squat cleans (14lb, 10lb)**

**4 partial wall walks or 8 inchworm push-ups**

**25 calorie row**

**25 wall ball squat cleans (14lb, 10lb)**

**3 partial wall walks or 6 inchworm push-ups**

**15 calorie row**

**15 wall ball squat cleans (14lb, 10lb)**

**2 partial wall walks or 4 inchworm push-ups**

**5 calorie row**

**5 wall ball squat cleans (14lb, 10lb)**

**1 partial wall walk or 2 inchworm push-ups**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
