[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

The benchmark workout “Nicholas” consists of a 2000 meter run, then a 5 minute rest, then 100 burpees, then a second 5 minute rest, then another 2000 meter run. This is a very tough WOD, but like with “Candy”, we’re going to give “Nicholas” a jolly Christmas makeover. Try it out, and see what you think!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

***Jolly Old Saint “Nicholas”***

**Experienced:**

**For time:**

**60/48 calorie air bike**

**Rest 3 minutes**

**50 burpees**

**Rest 3 minutes**

**60/48 calorie air bike**
<!--more-->

Beginners can modify both the movements and the rep scheme in today’s workout. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**For time:**

**30/24 calorie air bike**

**Rest 3 minutes**

**30 elevated, no push-up burpees**

**Rest 3 minutes**

**30/24 calorie air bike**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**For time:**

**45/36 calorie air bike**

**Rest 3 minutes**

**40 step-back burpees**

**Rest 3 minutes**

**45/36 calorie air bike**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
