Thank goodness it’s Friday! Let’s end the week with 4 rounds of 300 meters on the rower, 20 wall balls, and 10 toes-to-bar. If you’re feeling tired after working out all week, it’s okay to scale however you need to. Use a lighter wall ball, reduce the number of repetitions, or modify the toes-to-bar. Some workout is always better than no workout, so make the changes you need to make, get through it, and enjoy your weekend!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**4 rounds for time:**

**300 meter row**

**20 wall balls (20lb, 14lb)**

**10 toes-to-bar**

Athletes can scale today’s WOD by modifying the movements and scaling the number or repetitions. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**4 rounds for time:**

**300 meter row**

**15 wall balls, dumbbell thrusters (5lb, 3lb), air squats, or sit-to-stands**

**10 toes-to rig**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**4 rounds for time:**

**300 meter row**

**20 wall balls (14lb, 10lb)**

**10 hanging leg raises**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
