It’s Monday again, Community Fitness Club! Let’s kick off the week with a workout containing 15 rounds of 3 power cleans and 4 burpee box jump overs. Try going a little heavier on your power clean weight today, and really push to complete each round quickly.  As always, though, if your box jumps start to get shaky, slow down, lower your box height, or switch to box step-ups. No workout is worth getting injured for! 

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**15 rounds for time:**

**3 power cleans (135lb, 95lb)**

**4 burpee box jump overs (24in., 20in.)**
<!--more-->

A beginner can reduce the total number of rounds and modify the movements in today’s WOD. Dumbbell power cleans can be performed instead of power cleans with a barbell, and a set of modified burpees followed by a set of box jump overs can replace the burpee box jump overs. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**12 rounds for time:**

**3 dumbbell power cleans (15lb, 10lb)**

**4 elevated, no push-up burpees**

**4 box jump overs to a comfortable height**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**15 rounds for time:**

**3 power cleans (95lb, 65lb)**

**4 step-back burpee box jump overs to a comfortable height**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
