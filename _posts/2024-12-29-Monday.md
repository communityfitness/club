There are just two more days left of 2024, Community Fitness Club! Let’s mark the passing of the year with a workout named “2024” in which we will perform as many rounds of 20 air squats, 24 double unders, 20 box step-ups, and 24 mountain climbers as we can in the 20 minute time frame. Those air squats and box step-ups will really start to burn by the end of the workout, so adjust the WOD as necessary to make it right for you today!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

***2024***

**Experienced:**

**20 minute AMRAP:**

**20 air squats**

**24 double unders**

**20 box step-ups (24in., 20in.)**

**24 mountain climbers**
<!--more-->

Beginners can modify today’s workout by reducing the AMRAP’s time frame or by scaling the movements. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**20 air squats or sit-to-stands**

**24 imaginary jump rope or 12 single unders**

**20 box step-ups to a comfortable height**

**24 mountain climbers**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**20 minute AMRAP:**

**20 air squats**

**24 single unders or 12 double unders**

**20 box step-ups to a comfortable height**

**24 mountain climbers**

Your score is the total number of rounds and repetitions you complete during today’s workout.
