[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Today’s workout consists of 3 rounds of 100 double unders, 35 sit-ups, and 35 kettlebell swings. This will be challenging for some, so please modify it to make it right for you. Use the sit-ups to bring your heart rate down, and pick a weight for the kettlebell swings that allows you to complete the first round in no more than two sets. It is okay to adjust the rep scheme if you need to. Do your best, and that will be good enough!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**3 rounds for time:**

**100 double unders**

**35 abmat sit-ups**

**35 American kettlebell swings (53lb, 35lb)**
<!--more-->

Beginners can perform single unders or imaginary jump rope instead of double unders, anchored or assisted sit-ups instead of regular abmat sit-ups, and Russian kettlebell swings instead of American kettlebell swings. The rep scheme can also be modified. Do what works for you! A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**3 rounds for time:**

**50 single unders or 100 imaginary jump rope**

**20 anchored or assisted sit-up**

**30 Russian kettlebell swings (20lb, 15lb)**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**3 rounds for time:**

**50 double unders or 200 single unders**

**30 abmat sit-ups**

**35 American kettlebell swings (35lb, 22lb)**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
