[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Were you scared to try the *12 Days of Christmas *workout two weeks ago? If so, today’s workout will give you a taste of what you missed. I’m calling today’s WOD *The* *Reverse 12 Days of Christmas AMRAP*. For 20 minutes, we will complete each exercise in descending order starting with 12 deadlifts, then 11 Superman holds, 10 double unders, 9 sit-ups, 8 dumbbell box step-ups, 7 dumbbell power cleans, 6 box jumps, 5 burpees, 4 toes-to-bar, 3 handstand push-ups, 2 air squats, and 1 broad jump. We will then repeat this sequence again and again until the 20 minutes are up. 

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

***The Reverse 12 Days of Christmas AMRAP***

**Experienced:**

**20 minute AMRAP:**

**12 deadlifts (125lb, 95lb)**

**11 Superman holds**

**10 double unders**

**9 abmat sit-ups**

**8 dumbbell box step-ups (24in., 20in.) (50lb, 35lb)**

**4 toes-to-bar**

**3 handstand push-ups**

<!--more-->

AMRAPs scale automatically. A beginner will naturally perform fewer reps than an advanced athlete. However, it is usually necessary to scale other aspects of the workout as well. Make the changes you need to make so that the WOD is doable for you today. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**12 kettlebell deadlifts (20lb, 15lb)**

**11 Superman holds**

**10 single unders or imaginary jump rope**

**9 anchored or assisted sit-ups**

**8 dumbbell box step-ups to comfortable height (10lb, 5lb)**

**7 dumbbell power cleans or dumbbell hang power cleans (10lb, 5lb)**

**6 box jumps or box step-ups to a comfortable height**

**5 elevated, no push-up burpees**

**4 toes-to-rig**

**3 seated dumbbell presses (10lb, 5lb)**

**2 air squats or sit-to-stands**

**1 broad jump or single leg leap**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**20 minute AMRAP:**

**12 deadlifts (95lb, 65lb)**

**11 Superman holds**

**10 single unders**

**9 abmat sit-ups**

**8 dumbbell box step-ups to comfortable height (35lb, 25lb)**

**7 dumbbell power cleans (35lb, 25lb)**

**6 box jumps to comfortable height**

**5 step-back burpees**

**4 hanging knee raises**

**3 box handstand push-ups**

**2 air squats**

**1 broad jump**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total number of rounds and repetitions you complete during today’s AMRAP.
