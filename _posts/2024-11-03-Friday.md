[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

We will end the week with a tabata style workout containing dumbbell thrusters, mountain climbers, toes-to-bar, Superman holds, flutter kicks, downward-facing dog stretches, and cobra stretches. In a tabata, you perform a given movement for eight rounds of 20 seconds of work and 10 seconds of rest. 

To time today’s workout using the SmartWOD timer app: 

1. Select “TABATA”. 
2. Choose 8 rounds of 0:20 work, 0:10 rest.
3. Press the plus sign beside “Add sets (optional)”.
4. Coose 5 sets with 1:30 minutes of rest between sets. 
5. Press “START TIMER”.

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**Tabata 1 - Dumbbell thrusters (35lb, 25lb)**

***Rest 90 seconds***

**Tabata 2 - Mountain climbers**

***Rest 90 seconds***

**Tabata 3 - Toes-to-bar**

***Rest 90 seconds***

**Tabata 4 - Alternate between Superman hold and flutter kicks**

***Rest 90 seconds***

**Tabata 5 - Alternate between downward-facing dog stretch and cobra stretch**

Tabatas scale automatically. A beginner will naturally perform fewer reps and hold movements for less time than an advanced athlete. That’s okay! Just do your best, and scale the movements as needed. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**Tabata 1 - Dumbbell thrusters (5lb, 3lb), air squats, or sit-to-stands**

***Rest 90 seconds***

**Tabata 2 - Mountain climbers**

***Rest 90 seconds***

**Tabata 3 - Toes-to-rig**

***Rest 90 seconds***

**Tabata 4 - Alternate between Superman hold and flutter kicks**

***Rest 90 seconds***

**Tabata 5 - Alternate between downward-facing dog stretch and cobra stretch**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**Tabata 1 - Dumbbell thrusters (25lb, 15lb)**

***Rest 90 seconds***

**Tabata 2 - Mountain climbers**

***Rest 90 seconds***

**Tabata 3 - Hanging leg raises**

***Rest 90 seconds***

**Tabata 4 - Alternate between Superman hold and flutter kicks**

***Rest 90 seconds***

**Tabata 5 - Alternate between downward-facing dog stretch and cobra stretch**
