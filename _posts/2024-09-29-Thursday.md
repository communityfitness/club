[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Today’s workout is an AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”) containing box jumps, hang power cleans, and wall walks. The goal of today’s workout is to perform as many rounds of 5 box jumps, 3 hang power cleans, and 1 wall walk as you can in the 15 minute workout period. Please notice that the box jumps are higher and the hang power cleans are heavier than usual. Challenge yourself today!

However, please be cautious as well. Switch to lower box jumps or box step-ups if the higher box gets too difficult. Pick a weight for the hang power cleans that you can perform safely, and feel free to switch to partial wall walks or inchworms if you need to. You’ll still get in a great workout even if you make these modifications! So work hard, but be smart out there!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**5 box jumps (30in., 24in.)**

**3 hang power cleans (135lb, 95lb)**

**1 wall walk**
<!--more-->

AMRAPs scale automatically. A beginner will naturally perform fewer repetitions than an advanced athlete. However, it is often necessary to scale other aspects of the workout as well. Reduce the height of the box jumps, substitute dumbbell hang power cleans for hang power cleans with a barbell, and perform inchworms instead of wall walks. You can also perform box step-ups instead of box jumps if jumping doesn’t feel right for you today. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**5 box jumps or 6 box step-ups to a challenging height**

**3 dumbbell hang power cleans (15lb, 12lb)**

**2 inchworms**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**5 box jumps (24in., 20in.)**

**3 power cleans (95lb, 65lb)**

**1 partial wall walk or 2 inchworm push-ups**

Your score is the total number of rounds and repetitions you complete during the 15 minute AMRAP.
