[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Today’s workout is 4 rounds of 60 double unders, 20 dumbbell box step-ups, and 15 handstand push-ups. The double unders will test your cardio capabilities and coordination; the box step-ups will work your lower body and help correct muscular imbalances between your left and right sides; and the handstand push-ups will strengthen your upper body while providing a gymnastics challenge. Push hard, and finish as quickly as you can!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**4 rounds for time:**

**60 double unders**

**20 dumbbell box step-ups (24in., 20in.), (35lb, 25lb)**

**15 handstand push-ups**
<!--more-->

Beginners can perform single unders or imaginary jump rope instead of double unders, reduce the height of the box and the weight of the dumbbells for the dumbbell box step-ups, and substitute dumbbell push presses for the handstand push-ups. They can also the rep scheme as needed. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**4 rounds for time:**

**30 single unders or 60 imaginary jump rope**

**20 dumbbell box step-ups to a comfortable height (8lb, 5lb)**

**12 dumbbell push presses (8lb, 5lb)**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**4 rounds for time:**

**30 double unders or 120 single unders**

**20 dumbbell box step-ups to a comfortable height (20lb, 15lb)**

**15 box handstand push-ups**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
