It’s Monday, Community Fitness Club! Let’s kick off the week with a challenging 15-minute AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”). Today, we will perform as many rounds as we can of 19/15 calories on the air bike (19 calories for men, 15 calories for women) and 10 dumbbell thrusters in the 15 minute workout period. Pick a weight for the dumbbell thrusters that feels fairly light and easy. Try to challenge yourself by moving faster and keeping more rounds unbroken rather than by moving a heavier weight. 

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**For time:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**19/15 calorie air bike**

**10 dumbbell thrusters (35lb, 25lb)**
<!--more-->

AMRAPs scale automatically. Beginners will naturally perform fewer rounds and repetitions than more experienced athletes. However, other modifications can be made as well. You can lighten the weight for the dumbbell thrusters, or you can perform air squats or sit-to-stands instead. You can also modify the workout by performing fewer repetitions each round. Do what’s right for you! A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**For time:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**11/9 calorie air bike**

**8 dumbbell thrusters (5lb, 3lb) or air squats or sit-to-stands**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**For time:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**15/12 calorie air bike**

**10 thrusters (25lb, 15lb)**

Your score is the total number of rounds and reps you complete during the 15-minute AMRAP.
