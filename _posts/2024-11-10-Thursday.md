[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up) 

Today’s workout is a 12 minute AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”) in which we will complete as many rounds of 10 kettlebell swings, 10 alternating lunges, and 20 double unders as we can during the 12 minute workout period. Move quickly but carefully throughout the workout, and scale as needed. You will still get in a good workout even if you modify the movements, weights, or rep scheme!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**12 minute AMRAP:**

**10 American kettlebell swings (53lb, 35lb)**

**10 alternating lunges**

**20 double unders**
<!--more-->

AMRAPs scale automatically. A beginner will naturally perform fewer reps than an advanced athlete. However, it is often necessary to scale other aspects of the workout as well. Beginners can perform Russian instead of American kettlebell swings, single unders or imaginary jump rope instead of double unders, and can also modify the lunges and the rep scheme as needed. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**12 minute AMRAP:**

**10 Russian kettlebell swings (20lb, 15lb)**

**6 modified lunges**

**10 single unders or 20 imaginary jump rope**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**12 minute AMRAP:**

**10 American kettlebell swings (35lb, 22lb)**

**10 alternating lunges**

**10 double unders or 40 single unders**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total number of rounds and reps you complete during today’s workout.
