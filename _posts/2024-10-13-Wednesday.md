[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Today’s workout is a cardio-challenging AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”) in which you’ll perform as many rounds of 20 double unders, 15 kettlebell swings, 10 box jumps, and 5 hang power cleans as you can in the 15 minute workout period. Push hard, and do your best!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**20 double unders**

**15 American kettlebell swings (53lb, 35lb)**

**10 box jumps (24in., 20in.)**

**5 hang power cleans (95lb, 65lb)**
<!--more-->

A beginner can perform single unders or imaginary jump rope instead of  double unders, Russian kettlebell swings instead of American kettlebell swings, box jumps or box step-ups onto a shorter box, and dumbbell hang power cleans instead of hang power cleans with a barbell. The rep scheme can also be modified. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**15 single unders or 30 imaginary jump rope**

**12 Russian kettlebell swings (20lb, 15lb)**

**8 box jumps or box step-ups to a comfortable height**

**4 dumbbell hang power cleans (8lb, 5lb)**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**10 double unders or 40 single unders**

**15 American kettlebell swings (35lb, 22lb)**

**10 box jumps to a comfortable height**

**5 hang power cleans (65lb, 45lb)**

Your score is the total number of rounds and reps you complete during the 15 minute AMRAP.
