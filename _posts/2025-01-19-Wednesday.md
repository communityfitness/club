[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Today’s workout consists of 15 rounds of 12/10 calories on the rower (12 for men, 10 for women) followed by 1 wall walk with a 30 second rest after each round. Really try to stay consistent with your rower pace today. You don’t want your rowing to take 30 seconds the first round and 2 minutes the last round. Be smart, and pick a pace that you can maintain. You can do it! 

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**15 rounds for time:**

**12/10 calorie row**

**1 wall walk**

***Rest 30 seconds***

The experienced version of today’s workout is not suitable for everyone, and that’s okay! Beginners can reduce the total number of rounds, scale the number of calories rowed each round, and substitute inchworms for wall walks. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**10 rounds for time:**

**10/8 calorie row**

**2 inchworms**

***Rest 30 seconds***

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**12 rounds for time:**

**12/10 calorie row**

**1 partial wall walk or 2 inchworm push-ups**

***Rest 30 seconds***

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
