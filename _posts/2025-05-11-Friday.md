TGIF, Community Fitness Club! We will close out this week with a short couplet of double unders and wall walks. The goal of today’s workout is to complete 4 rounds of 50 double unders and 4 wall walks as quickly as possible. Though the goal is to move quickly, please be careful on your wall walks. If you start to feel shaky, please modify as needed. I want you to be able to enjoy your weekend! You’ve earned it!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**4 rounds for time:**

**50 double unders**

**4 wall walks**
<!--more-->

Beginners can perform single unders or imaginary jump rope instead of double unders and inchworms instead of wall walks. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**4 rounds for time:**

**40 single unders or 80 imaginary jump rope**

**8 inchworms**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**4 rounds for time:**

**25 double unders or 100 single unders**

**4 partial wall walks or box wall walks**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
