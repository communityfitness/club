[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Today’s workout consists of 5 rounds of 10 power cleans, 10 toes-to-bar, and 2 wall walks. Challenge yourself with a heavier weight today. It’s okay to break up the power cleans and toes-to-bar as needed. As always, be careful on the wall walks! If you find yourself getting shaky, either modify the wall walk or take a slightly longer break. Work hard, but be smart! 

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**5 rounds for time:**

**10 power cleans (135lb, 95lb)**

**10 toes-to-bar**

**2 wall walks**
<!--more-->

A beginner can modify the number of repetitions per round and scale the movements in today’s WOD to make it more doable. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**5 rounds for time:**

**8 dumbbell power cleans (12lb, 8lb)**

**8 toes-to-rig**

**4 inchworms**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**5 rounds for time:**

**10 power cleans (95lb, 65lb)**

**10 hanging leg raises**

**2 partial wall walks or box wall walks**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
