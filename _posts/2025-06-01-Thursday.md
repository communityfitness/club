[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

For today’s workout, you will complete as many rounds of 15 kettlebell deadlifts, 12 box jumps, 9 kettlebell swings, 6 handstand push-ups, and 3 pull-ups as you can in 18 minutes. Even though the goal is to move fast, please be mindful of your form throughout the workout. Keep your back flat during your kettlebell deadlifts. Be careful doing your box jumps, and stand up all the way at the top of each one. And, as always, modify the workout as needed. You know your body best. Scale the workout to make it right for you today.

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**18 minute AMRAP:**

**15 kettlebell deadlifts (53lb, 35lb)**

**12 box jumps (24in. 20in.)**

**9 American kettlebell swings (53lb, 35lb)**

**6 handstand push-ups**

**3 pull-ups**

Beginners can modify the workout as needed. Box step-ups can be performed instead of box jumps; Russian kettlebell swings can be substituted for American kettlebell swings; seated dumbbell presses can replace handstand push-ups; and ring rows can be performed instead of pull-ups. The weights can also be reduced throughout the workout. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**16 minute AMRAP:**

**15 kettlebell deadlifts (20lb, 15lb)**

**12 box jumps or box step-ups to a comfortable height**

**9 Russian kettlebell swings (20lb, 15lb)**

**6 seated dumbbell presses (8lb, 5lb)**

**3 ring rows**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**18 minute AMRAP:**

**15 kettlebell deadlifts (35lb, 22lb)**

**12 box jumps to a comfortable height**

**9 American kettlebell swings (35lb, 22lb)**

**6 box handstand push-ups or handstand kick-ups with slow descent**

**3 jumping or banded pull-ups**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total number of rounds and reps you complete during the workout.
