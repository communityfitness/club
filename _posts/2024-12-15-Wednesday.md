[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up) 

Today’s workout is named “The 12 Days of Christmas,” and it’s a doozy! Like the song, we will complete each exercise in the WOD in ascending order and then work back down to one, adding one exercise per round. 

It will look like this: you will perform 1 broad jump; then you will perform 2 air squats and 1 broad jump; then 3 handstand push-ups, 2 air squats, and 1 broad jump; then then 4 toes-to-bar, 3 handstand push-ups, 2 air squats, and 1 broad jump; etc. until you finish with 12 deadlifts, 11 Superman holds, 10 double unders, 9 sit-ups, 8 dumbbell box step-ups, 7 dumbbell hang power cleans, 6 box jumps, 5 burpees, 4 toes-to-bar, 3 handstand push-ups, 2 air squats, and 1 broad jump. 

This will be a long one, so don’t be afraid to give yourself a time cap, anywhere from 20 to 40 minutes according to how much time you have available today, and treat today’s workout like an AMRAP. Just get as much work done as you can, and quit when your time is up!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

***The 12 Days of Christmas***

**Experienced:**

**For time, adding one movement per round:**

Beginners can modify the movements to match their current fitness level. Also, feel free to give yourself a time cap that seems reasonable. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**For time, adding one movement per round:**

**1 broad jump or single leg leap**

**2 air squats or sit-to-stands**

**3 seated dumbbell presses (8lb, 5lb)**

**4 toes-to-rig**

**5 elevated, no push-up burpees**

**6 box jumps to comfortable height**

**7 dumbbell hang power cleans (8lb, 5lb)**

**9 anchored or assisted sit-ups**

**10 single unders or imaginary jump rope**

**11 Superman holds**

**12 kettlebell deadlifts (35lb, 22lb)**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**For time, adding one movement per round:**

**1 broad jump**

**2 air squats**

**3 box handstand push-ups**

**4 hanging knee raises**

**5 step-back burpees**

**6 box jumps to comfortable height**

**7 dumbbell hang power cleans (35lb, 25lb)**

**8 dumbbell box step-ups to comfortable height (35lb, 25lb)**

**9 abmat sit-ups**

**10 single unders**

**11 Superman holds**

**12 deadlifts (115lb, 85lb)**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout or the number of rounds and reps you finished in your time cap.
