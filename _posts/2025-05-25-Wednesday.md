Since Monday’s WOD was so extreme, we’ll keep today’s workout short and light. Today we will complete a 13 minute AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”) consisting of rounds of 5 calories on the air bike, 10 power cleans, 5 push presses, and 15 sit-ups, trying to complete as many rounds and repetitions as possible. Don’t go heavy today. Pick a weight that feels easy and allows you to keep moving. 

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**13 minute AMRAP:**

**5 calorie air bike**

**10 power cleans (75lb, 55lb)**

**5 push presses (75lb, 55lb)**

**15 abmat sit-ups**
<!--more-->

AMRAPs scale automatically. A beginner will naturally perform fewer reps than an advanced athlete. However, it is often necessary to scale other aspects of the workout as well. Beginners can perform dumbbell power cleans or dumbbell hang power cleans instead of power cleans with a barbell and can modify the sit-ups. The rep scheme can also be modified. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**13 minute AMRAP:**

**3 calorie air bike**

**6 dumbbell power cleans or hang power cleans (5lb, 3lb)**

**3 dumbbell push presses (5lb, 3lb)**

**9 anchored or assisted sit-ups**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**13 minute AMRAP:**

**5 calorie air bike**

**10 power cleans (45lb, 35lb)**

**5 push presses (45lb, 35lb)**

**12 abmat sit-ups**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total number of rounds and reps you complete during today’s workout.
