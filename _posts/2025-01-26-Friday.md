[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

TGIF, Community Fitness Club! We will end this burpee-tastic week with a tabata-style workout containing burpees (Surprise!), box jumps, inchworm push-ups, alternating lunges, and a nice cool down of child's pose and downward-facing dog stretch.

In a tabata, you perform a given movement for eight rounds of 20 seconds of work, 10 seconds of rest. If you have downloaded the SmartWOD timer, it has an easy to use tabata function. For today’s WOD: 

(1) Press “TABATA”. 

(2) Select 8 rounds of 0:20 work, 0:10 rest. 

(3) Click on the plus sign beside “Add sets”. 

(4) Select 5 sets with 1:30 minutes of rest between sets.

(5) Press "START TIMER".

You can also use “tabata songs” on YouTube to time your workout. Check out the link at the bottom of the post for more information. 

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**For time:**

**Tabata 1 - Burpees**

**Rest 90 seconds**

**Tabata 2 - Box jumps (24in., 20in.)**

**Rest 90 seconds**

**Tabata 3 - Inchworm push-ups**

**Rest 90 seconds**

**Tabata 4 - Alternating lunges**

**Tabata 5 - Alternating rounds of 20 seconds of downward-facing dog stretch and 20 seconds of child’s pose**

Tabatas scale automatically. A beginner will naturally perform fewer reps than an advanced athlete. However, it may be necessary to scale the movements as well. Make the changes that are appropriate for you today. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**For time:**

**Tabata 1 - Elevated, no push-up burpees**

**Rest 90 seconds**

**Tabata 2 - Box jumps or box step-ups to a comfortable height**

**Rest 90 seconds**

**Tabata 3 - Inchworms**

**Rest 90 seconds**

**Tabata 4 - Modified lunges**

**Rest 90 seconds**

**Tabata 5 - Alternating rounds of 20 seconds of downward-facing dog stretch and 20 seconds of child’s pose**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**For time:**

**Tabata 1 - Step-back burpees**

**Rest 90 seconds**

**Tabata 2 - Box jumps to a comfortable height**

**Rest 90 seconds**

**Tabata 3 - Alternating rounds of inchworm push-ups and inchworms**

**Rest 90 seconds**

**Tabata 4 - Alternating lunges**

**Rest 90 seconds**

**Tabata 5 - Alternating rounds of 20 seconds of downward-facing dog stretch and 20 seconds of child’s pose**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.
