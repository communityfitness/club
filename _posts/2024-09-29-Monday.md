[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

It’s the last day of September, Community Fitness Club! Let’s see out the month with a descending ladder of handstand push-ups and wall ball squat cleans. In today’s WOD we will perform 10 handstand push-ups and 20 wall ball squat cleans, followed by 9 handstand push-ups and 18 wall ball squat cleans, then 8 handstand push-ups and 16 wall ball squat cleans, decreasing by 1 repetition for handstand push-ups and 2 repetitions for wall ball squat cleans each round until we finish with 1 handstand push-up and 2 wall ball squat cleans. Every round will get easier, so push hard, and get it done as quickly as possible. You can do this!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**For time:**

**10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1:**

**Handstand push-ups**

**20-18-16-14-12-10-8-6-4-2:**

**Wall ball squat cleans (20lb, 14lb)**
<!--more-->

If this type of workout is new to you, feel free to modify the WOD as needed. You can reduce the total number of wall ball squat cleans you perform; substitute wall ball goblet squats, air squats, or sit-to-stands for the wall ball squat cleans; and substitute seated dumbbell presses for the handstand push-ups. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**For time:**

**10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1:**

**Seated dumbbell presses (5lb, 3lb)**

**Wall ball squat cleans (10lb, 10lb), wall ball goblet squats, air squats, or sit-to-stands**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**For time:**

**10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1:**

**Box handstand push-ups or seated dumbbell presses (30lb, 20lb)**

**20-18-16-14-12-10-8-6-4-2:**

**Wall ball squat cleans (14lb, 10lb)**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
