Happy Monday, Community Fitness Club! Our first workout of the week consists of as many rounds of 5 pull-ups, 10 push-ups, 15 sit-ups, and 20 air squats as you can complete in 20 minutes. Today’s WOD is pretty straightforward, but still please modify the movements and scale the number of repetitions per round appropriately. You know your body best! Do what is right for you today!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**20 minute AMRAP:**

**5 pull-ups**

**10 push-ups**

**15 abmat sit-ups**

**20 air squats**

<!--more-->

Beginners can modify the movements and adjust the rep scheme in today’s workout to make it more doable. The time limit can be shortened as needed as well. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**16 minute AMRAP:**

**3 ring rows**

**6 wall push-ups**

**9 anchored or assisted sit-ups**

**12 air squats or sit-to-stands**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**20 minute AMRAP:**

**5 jumping or banded pull-ups**

**10 kneeling push-ups or box push-ups or 5 regular push-ups**

**15 abmat sit-ups**

**20 air squats**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. Your score is the total number of rounds and repetitions you complete in today’s workout.
