It’s Monday, Community Fitness Club, and today’s workout is an AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”) in which you will perform as many rounds of 5 pull-ups, 10 air squats, 5 burpees, and 10 kettlebell swings as you can in 18 minutes. Just do your best, and scale the workout as needed. This one should be tough but fun!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**18 minute AMRAP:**

**5 pull-ups**

**10 air squats**

**5 burpees**

**10 American kettlebell swings (53lb, 35lb)**
<!--more-->

Beginners can scale today’s WOD by modifying the rep scheme and the movements. Beginning athletes can substitute ring rows for pull-ups, modified burpees for regular burpees, and Russian kettlebell swings for American kettlebell swings. It is also okay to shorten the workout as needed. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**16 minute AMRAP:**

**3 ring rows**

**6 air squats or sit-to-stands**

**4 elevated, no push-up burpees**

**8 Russian kettlebell swings (15lb, 10lb)**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**18 minute AMRAP:**

**5 jumping or banded pull-ups**

**10 air squats**

**5 step-back burpees**

**10 American kettlebell swings (35lb, 22lb)**

Your score is the total number of rounds and repetitions you complete during today’s workout.
