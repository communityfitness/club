Today’s WOD (“Workout of the Day”) will get you sweaty while working every part of your body! For 15 rounds, you will alternate between performing 10 wall balls and rowing 100 meters. Each round is short, so pace yourself and scale appropriately. You can do it!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**15 rounds for time:**

**10 wall balls (20lb, 14lb)**

**100 meter row**
<!--more-->

Beginners can scale today’s workout by reducing the total number of rounds and by modifying the wall balls as needed. If wall balls aren’t right for you today, try performing dumbbell thrusters, wall ball goblet squats, or sit-to-stands instead. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**10 rounds for time:**

**10 wall balls, dumbbell thrusters (5lb, 3lb), wall ball goblet squats, or sit-to-stands**

**100 meter row**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**13 rounds for time:**

**10 wall balls (14lb, 10lb)**

**100 meter row**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
