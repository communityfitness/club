[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

In today’s workout, you will perform a descending ladder of calories on the air bike and deadlifts. You will begin by performing 20 air bike calories and 20 deadlifts. Then you will perform 16 air bike calories and 16 deadlifts, followed by 12 air bike calories and 12 deadlifts, 8 air bike calories and 8 deadlifts, and finally 4 air bike calories and 4 deadlifts. I enjoy this type of rep scheme because every round gets easier!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**For time:**

**20-16-12-8-4:**

**Air bike calories**

**Deadlifts (135lb, 95lb)**

Beginners can scale the rep scheme of today’s workout and substitute kettlebell deadlifts for barbell deadlifts. Do what’s right for you, and please move through each set of deadlifts carefully to maintain proper form! A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**For time:**

**15-12-9-6-3:**

**Air bike calories**

**20-16-12-8-4:**

**Kettlebell deadlifts (15lb, 10lb)**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**For time:**

**18-14-10-6-4:**

**Air bike calories**

**20-16-12-8-4:**

**Deadlifts (95lb, 75lb)**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
