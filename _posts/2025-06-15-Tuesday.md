It’s Tabata Tuesday, Community Fitness Club! Today we will complete five tabatas with a 30 second rest between each one. The rests are short, but really try to push your intensity levels today anyway. You can do it!

To time today’s workout using the SmartWOD timer app, use the following steps:
1. Press “TABATA”.
2. Choose 8 rounds of 0:20 work and 0:10 rest.
3. Press the plus sign beside “Add sets (optional)”.
4. Choose 5 sets and 0:30 rest.
5. Press “START TIMER”.

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**Tabata 1 - alternate between high knees and bear crawl**

***Rest 30 seconds***

**Tabata 2 - alternate between kettlebell deadlifts (53lb, 35lb) and jumping jacks**

***Rest 30 seconds***

**Tabata 3 - alternate between inchworm push-ups and squat jumps**

***Rest 30 seconds***

**Tabata 4 - alternate between Russian twists with a dumbbell (20lb, 15lb) and glute bridges**

***Rest 30 seconds***

**Tabata 5 - alternate between flutter kicks and Superman hold**
<!--more-->

Tabatas scale automatically. Beginner athletes will naturally perform fewer reps than an advanced athlete. That’s okay! Also, please don’t worry if you can’t perform a movement for a full 20 seconds each round. Do what you can, and that will be enough! A scaled version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled:**

**Tabata 1 - alternate between high knees or march in place and bear crawl**

***Rest 30 seconds***

**Tabata 2 - alternate between kettlebell deadlifts (35lb, 22lb) and jumping jacks**

***Rest 30 seconds***

**Tabata 3 - alternate between inchworms and air squats or sit-to-stands**

***Rest 30 seconds***

**Tabata 4 - alternate between Russian twists and glute bridges**

***Rest 30 seconds***

**Tabata 5 - alternate between flutter kicks and Superman hold**
