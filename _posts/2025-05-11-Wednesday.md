[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Today’s workout will begin with a buy-in of 20 calories on the rower. Then we will complete 4 rounds of 5 deadlifts and 10 pull-ups. Finally, we will finish with a buy-out of another 20 calories on the rower. Be smart when picking your weight for the deadlifts today. Pick a weight that feels heavy and challenging but that you can still complete with good form throughout. Also, please remember: if something doesn’t feel right, it is always okay to drop to a lighter weight or to scale or modify in another way! Take care of yourselves out there!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**For time:**

**Buy-in: 20 calorie row**

**4 rounds:**

**5 deadlifts (255lb, 175lb)**

**10 pull-ups**

**Buy-out: 20 calorie row**

If this type of workout is new to you, you can modify it in many ways. You can perform kettlebell deadlifts instead of barbell deadlifts and ring rows instead of pull-ups. You can also modify the rep scheme and reduce the number of calories you row at the beginning and end of the workout. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**For time:**

**Buy-in: 15 calorie row**

**4 rounds:**

**5 kettlebell deadlifts (35lb, 22lb)**

**8 ring rows**

**Buy-out: 15 calorie row**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**For time:**

**Buy-in: 20 calorie row**

**4 rounds:**

**5 deadlifts (175lb, 115lb)**

**10 jumping or banded pull-ups or 5 regular pull-ups**

**Buy-out: 20 calorie row**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
