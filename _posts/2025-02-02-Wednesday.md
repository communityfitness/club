[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Today’s workout is a 14 minute AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”) in which the goal is to complete as many rounds of 16 sit-ups, 12/10 air bike calories, and 8 thrusters as you can in the 14 minute workout period. Pick scaling options that allow you to keep moving and push to complete as many rounds and repetitions as you can!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**14 minute AMRAP:**

**16 abmat sit-ups**

**12/10 calories air bike**

**8 thrusters  (95lb, 65lb)**
<!--more-->

Beginners can scale the movements and rep scheme in today’s WOD to make it more doable. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**14 minute AMRAP:**

**10 anchored or assisted sit-ups**

**8/6 calories air bike**

**6 dumbbell thrusters (5lb, 3lb) or air squats or sit-to-stands**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**14 minute AMRAP:**

**14 abmat sit-ups**

**10/8 calories air bike**

**8 thrusters (45lb, 35lb)**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total number of rounds and repetitions you complete during today’s workout.
