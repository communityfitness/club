[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Christmas is almost here, Community Fitness Club! Let’s celebrate with an AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”) that I’ve dubbed “Christmas Carol Medley.” It consists of three movements - rowing for calories, kettlebell swings, and wall balls - and each movement comes with its own Christmas carol that you can sing during the WOD. (Or not!) Without further ado, here are the carols:

*Kettlebells (to the tune of “Jingle Bells”)*

*Kettlebells, kettlebells,*<br/>
*Stronger every day.*<br/>
*Oh what fun it is to swing*<br/>
*Kettlebells this way!*

*Deck the Wall Balls (to the tune of “Deck the Halls”)*

*Deck the walls with medicine balls,*<br/>
*Fa la la la la, la la la la.*<br/>
*Catch it quick before it falls!*<br/>
*Fa la la la la, la la la la.*

*Rowing Wonderland (to the tune of “Winter Wonderland”)*

*The timer rings, are you listening?*<br/>
*In the gym, sweat is glistening.*<br/>
*A beautiful sight,*<br/>
*We’re happy tonight,*<br/>
*Rowing in a winter wonderland.*

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

***Christmas Carol Medley***<br/>
**Experienced:**

**16 minute AMRAP:**<br/>
**20 calorie row**<br/>
**20 American kettlebell swings (53lb, 35lb)**<br/>
**20 wall balls (20lb, 14lb)**
<!--more-->

Beginners can scale today’s workout to make it more doable. You can reduce the weights of both the kettlebell swings and the wall balls, scale the rep scheme, and perform Russian rather than American kettlebell swings. If you struggle with wall balls, you can substitute dumbbell thrusters, goblet squats, or sit-to-stands. Make the changes that are right for you today! A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**16 minute AMRAP:**<br/>
**10 calorie row**<br/>
**10 Russian kettlebell swings (20lb, 15lb)**<br/>
**10 wall balls, dumbbell thrusters (5lb, 3lb), wall ball goblet squats, or sit-to-stands**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**16 minute AMRAP:**<br/>
**15 calorie row**<br/>
**15 American kettlebell swings (35lb, 22lb)**<br/>
**15 Wall balls (14lb, 10lb)**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total number of rounds and reps you complete in today’s workout.
