[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

For today’s WOD (“Workout of the Day”), you will perform 3 rounds of a 20 calorie row, 20 dumbbell walking lunges, and 20 hang power cleans. Try to pick scaling options that are moderately difficult today. Shoot for a weight for the lunges and cleans that would be difficult to complete unbroken but doable in 2 or 3 sets. Be smart, and work hard out there today!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**3 rounds for time:**

**20 calorie row**

**20 dumbbell walking lunges (50lb, 35lb)**

**20 hang power cleans (115lb, 85lb)**
<!--more-->

Beginners can scale the number of repetitions and modify the lunges and power cleans to make today’s workout more doable. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**3 rounds for time:**

**16 calorie row**

**16 modified lunges**

**16 dumbbell hang power cleans (12lb, 8lb)**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**3 rounds for time:**

**18 calorie row**

**18 dumbbell walking lunges (35lb, 22lb)**

**18 hang power cleans (85lb, 65lb)**
