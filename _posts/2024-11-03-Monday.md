It’s Monday again, Community Fitness Club! Our first workout of the week is a challenging benchmark workout known as “Cindy.”  Benchmark workouts are named workouts that are performed by people all across the world to compare their fitness levels to each other and to measure their personal progress. Why give a workout a girl’s name? Greg Glassman, inventor of CrossFit, once said that like a hurricane “anything that leaves you flat on your back, looking up to the sky wondering ‘what just happened to me?’ deserves a female’s name.” 

Today’s workout is an AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”). You will perform as many rounds of 5 pull-ups, 10 push-ups, and 15 air squats as you can during the 20 minute workout period. Try to pace yourself so that you don’t burn out during the first half of the workout.Today’s WOD is tough, so feel free to scale the movements as needed to accommodate your current fitness level.

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

***Cindy***

**Experienced:**

**20 minute AMRAP:**

**5 pull-ups**

**10 push-ups**

**15 air squats**
<!--more-->

AMRAPs scale automatically. A beginner will naturally perform fewer rounds and repetitions than an advanced athlete. However, in this WOD 20 minutes might seem overwhelming to a beginner. Pick a reasonable time period for you, and feel free to take breaks as needed. You can always keep going if you’re still feeling strong at the end of the workout! A beginner will also need to scale the movements. Pick the pull-up, push-up, and air squat modifications that are right for you. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**16 minute AMRAP:**

**4 ring rows**

**8 wall push-ups**

**12 air squats or sit-to-stands**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**20 minute AMRAP:**

**5 jumping or banded pull-ups**

**10 kneeling or box push-ups**

**15 air squats**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total number of rounds and reps you complete during today’s workout.
