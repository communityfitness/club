Happy Thanksgiving, Community Fitness Club! Many of you will be very busy today, so here is a short AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”) that you can do at home. The WOD is only 10 minutes long, so try to squeeze it in somewhere. You’ll be glad you did! 

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

***Squeeze It In***

**Experienced:**

**10 minute AMRAP:**

**5 inchworm push-ups**

**5 Superman holds**

**10 mountain climbers (Each leg counts as 1 rep.)**
<!--more-->

AMRAPs scale automatically. A beginner will naturally perform fewer reps than an advanced athlete. However, a beginner might find 5 inchworm push-ups per round to be too challenging. Replace the inchworm push-ups with plain inchworms and reduce the reps to a number that seems doable. A beginner version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**10 minute AMRAP:**

**2 inchworms**

**5 Superman holds**

**10 mountain climbers (Each leg counts as 1 rep.)**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**10 minute AMRAP:**

**5 inchworms to kneeling push-ups**

**5 Superman holds**

**10 mountain climbers (Each leg counts as 1 rep.)**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the number of rounds and reps you complete during the 10 minute AMRAP.
