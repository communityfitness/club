[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

In today’s WOD (“Workout of the Day”), you will have 15 minutes to complete 2 rounds of 25 kettlebell swings, 20 sit-ups, 15 kettlebell box step-ups, 10 handstand push-ups, and 5 deadlifts. You will then finish the workout by performing as many burpees as you can in whatever time you have remaining. Though the goal is to move through the movements as quickly as possible, please be mindful of keeping good form throughout the workout and picking scaling modifications that are appropriate for you. You know your body best! Work hard, and do what’s best for you!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**In 15 minutes complete 2 rounds:**

**25 American kettlebell swings (53lb, 35lb)**

**20 abmat sit-ups**

**15 kettlebell box step-ups (24in., 20in.), (53lb, 35lb)**

**10 handstand push-ups**

**5 deadlifts (225lb, 155lb)**

**Then max effort burpees in remaining time**
<!--more-->

If this type of workout is new to you, please feel free to modify both the movements and the rep scheme. You can substitute  Russian kettlebell swings for American kettlebell swings, anchored or assisted sit-ups for abmat sit-ups, seated dumbbell presses for handstand push-ups, and kettlebell deadlifts for barbell deadlifts. You can also pick whatever burpee modification works best for you. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**In 15 minutes complete 2 rounds:**

**15 Russian kettlebell swings (20lb, 15lb)**

**12 anchored or assisted sit-ups**

**9 kettlebell box step-ups to a comfortable height (20lb, 15lb)**

**6 seated dumbbell presses (5lb, 3lb)**

**3 kettlebell deadlifts (35lb, 22lb)**

**Then max effort elevated, no push-up burpees in remaining time**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**In 15 minutes complete 2 rounds:**

**25 American kettlebell swings (35lb, 22lb)**

**20 abmat sit-ups**

**15 kettlebell box step-ups to a comfortable height (35lb, 22lb)**

**10 box handstand push-ups or seated dumbbell presses (30lb, 20lb)**

**5 deadlifts (135lb, 95lb)**

**Then max effort step-back burpees in remaining time**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total number of burpees you perform in today’s workout.
