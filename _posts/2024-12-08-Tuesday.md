Today’s WOD consists of 8 rounds of 10 Russian kettlebell swings and 25 double unders. Consider challenging yourself today by using a heavier kettlebell than usual or picking a harder scaling option for the jump rope. Today’s WOD is an excellent opportunity to practice your patience and perseverance! 

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD. Notice that the kettlebell swings are Russian, that is swung to eye level and also heavier than usual!

**Experienced:**

**8 rounds for time:**

**10 Russian kettlebell swings (71lb, 53lb)**

**25 double unders**

Beginners should pick a kettlebell weight that they can perform safely. Don’t worry about performing heavy swings; pick a weight that you can swing with good form. You can also substitute single unders or imaginary jump rope for the double unders. Choose the options that are right for you today!

**Scaled 1:**

**8 rounds for time:**

**10 Russian kettlebell swings (20lb, 15lb)**

**15 single unders or 30 imaginary jump rope**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**8 rounds for time:**

**20 Russian kettlebell swings (53lb, 35lb)**

**15 double unders or 60 single unders**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
