If you aren’t up for the experienced-level workout today, there are a couple of ways to make it easier. You can scale the rep scheme, and you can also modify the burpees. There are many different ways to modify burpees. Check out the link at the bottom of the page for more information. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**
