Hopefully seven is your lucky number, because today’s WOD consists of 7 rounds of 7 burpees, 7 air bike calories, 7 toes-to-bar, and 7 deadlifts. Pick a weight for the deadlifts that you can perform unbroken with good form throughout the workout. Work hard! You can do it!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**7 rounds for time:**

**7 burpees**

**7 calorie air bike**

**7 toes-to-bar**

**7 deadlifts (185lb, 135lb)**
<!--more-->

A beginner can modify the burpees, substitute kettlebell deadlifts for barbell deadlifts, and substitute toes-to-rig for toes-to-wall. It is also okay to reduce the total number of rounds to make today’s workout more doable. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**5 rounds for time:**

**7 elevated, no push-up burpees**

**7 calorie air bike**

**7 toes-to-rig**

**7 kettlebell deadlifts (20lb, 15lb)**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**7 rounds for time:**

**7 step-back burpees**

**7 calorie air bike**

**7 hanging leg raises**

**7 deadlifts (125lb, 95lb)**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
