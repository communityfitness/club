[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

We will begin this holiday week with a Thanksgiving-themed tabata workout. In a tabata, you perform a given movement for eight rounds of 20 seconds of work and 10 seconds of rest. 

To time today’s workout using the SmartWOD timer app: 

1. Select “TABATA”. 
2. Choose 8 rounds of 0:20 work, 0:10 rest.
3. Press the plus sign beside “Add sets (optional)”.
4. Choose 5 sets with 1:30 minutes of rest between sets. 
5. Press “START TIMER”.

You can also use “tabata songs” on YouTube to time your workout. Check out the link at the bottom of the post for more information. 

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

***Thanksgiving Tabata***

**Experienced:**

**Tabata 1 - “Turkey trot” aka high knees**

***Rest 90 seconds***

**Tabata 2 - “Wing workers” aka dumbbell push presses (50lb, 35lb)**

***Rest 90 seconds***

**Tabata 3 - “Harvest hops” aka double unders**

***Rest 90 seconds***

**Tabata 4 - “Planksgiving” aka plank (Alternate between high plank, low plank, right arm side plank, and left arm side plank.)**

***Rest 90 seconds***

**Tabata 5 - “Turkey feather flappers” aka jumping jacks**

Tabatas scale automatically. A beginner will naturally perform fewer reps than an advanced athlete. However, it may also be necessary to scale the movements. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**Tabata 1 -“Turkey trot” aka high knees or march in place**

***Rest 90 seconds***

**Tabata 2 - “Wing workers” aka dumbbell push press (8lb, 5lb)**

***Rest 90 seconds***

**Tabata 3 - “Harvest hops” aka imaginary jump rope or single unders**

***Rest 90 seconds***

**Tabata 4 - “Planksgiving” aka plank**

***Rest 90 seconds***

**Tabata 5 - “Turkey feather flappers” aka jumping jacks**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**Tabata 1 - “Turkey trot” aka high knees**

***Rest 90 seconds***

**Tabata 2 - “Wing workers” aka dumbbell push press (35lb, 20lb)**

***Rest 90 seconds***

**Tabata 3 - “Harvest hops” aka single unders**

***Rest 90 seconds***

**Tabata 4 - “Planksgiving” aka plank (Alternate between high plank and low plank.)**

***Rest 90 seconds***

**Tabata 5 - “Turkey feather flappers” aka jumping jacks**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.
