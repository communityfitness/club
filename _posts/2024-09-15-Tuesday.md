Today’s WOD (“Workout of the Day”) is two workouts in one! You will begin with 50 double unders and 50 kettlebell swings, followed by 40 double unders and 40 kettlebell swings, then 30 double unders and 30 kettlebell swings, then 20 double unders and 20 kettlebell swings, and finally 10 double unders and 10 kettlebell swings. You will then rest for three minutes before continuing on to the second part of the workout: 25 air bike calories and 25 sit-ups, followed by 20 air bike calories and 20 sit-ups, then 15 air bike calories and 15 sit-ups, then 10 air bike calories and 10 sit-ups, and finally 5 air bike calories and 5 sit-ups. Pace yourself today, and be smart picking your kettlebell weight. Go lighter so that you can complete large sets unbroken. This is a tough one, but you can do it!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**For time:**

**50-40-30-20-10:**

**American kettlebell swings (35lb, 22lb)**

**_Rest 3 minutes_**

**25-20-15-10-5:**

**Air bike calories**

**Abmat sit-ups**

Beginners can scale the rep scheme in today’s workout. They can also substitute single unders or imaginary jump rope for double unders and Russian kettlebell swings for American kettlebell swings. Make the workout right for you! A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**For time:**

**40-30-20-10:**

**Single unders (or 80-60-40-20 imaginary jump rope)**

**Russian kettlebell swings (15lb, 10lb)**

**_Rest 3 minutes_**

**16-12-8-4:**

**Air bike calories**

**Anchored or assisted sit-ups**
