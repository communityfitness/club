Happy New Year’s Eve, Community Fitness Club! Our workout today is a chipper style WOD called “12/31” which is made up of 31 repetitions of 12 different movements. This workout is on the longer side, so feel free to set a time cap if your time today is limited. Good luck!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

***12/31***

**Experienced:**

**For time:**

**31 unbroken double unders**

**31 push-ups**

**31 wall balls (20lb, 14lb)**

**31 abmat sit-ups**

Beginners can modify the movements and the weights to make today’s workout more doable. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**For time:**

**31 imaginary jump rope or 15 single unders**

**31 wall push-ups**

**31 wall balls (10lb, 10lb) or dumbbell thrusters (5lb, 3lb)**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:
