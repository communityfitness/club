[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Today is Tabata Tuesday, Community Fitness Club! We will begin with a tabata of air biking for calories, then we will rest for one minute. Our next four tabatas will consist of 20 seconds of Russian kettlebell swings, followed by 20 seconds of burpees, followed by 20 seconds of dumbbell push presses, followed by 20 seconds of alternating lunges, then another 20 seconds of Russian kettlebell swings, another 20 seconds of burpees, another 20 seconds of dumbbell push presses, and another 20 seconds of alternating lunges. You will rest one minute between each tabata. Your score will be the total number of repetitions you perform across all 5 tabatas, so work hard and get in as many reps as possible!

To time today’s WOD using the SmartWOD timer app:

(1) Press “TABATA”. 

(2) Select 8 rounds of 0:20 work, 0:10 rest. 

(3) Click on the plus sign beside “Add sets”. 

(4) Select 5 sets with 1 minute of rest between sets.

(5) Press "START TIMER".

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**Tabata 1 - Air bike for calories**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 2 - Rotate through Russian kettlebell swings (53lb, 35lb), burpees, dumbbell push presses (35lb, 25lb), and alternating lunges**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 3 - Rotate through Russian kettlebell swings (53lb, 35lb), burpees, dumbbell push presses (35lb, 25lb), and alternating lunges**

***Rest 1 minute***

Tabatas scale automatically. Beginners will naturally perform fewer repetitions than experienced athletes. However, other scaling measures might also be necessary. In today’s workout, the weight of the kettlebell swings and dumbbell push presses can be reduced, and the burpees and lunges can be modified as needed. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**Tabata 1 - Air bike for calories**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 2 - Rotate through Russian kettlebell swings (15lb, 10lb); elevated, no push-up burpees; dumbbell push presses (8lb, 5lb); and modified lunges**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 3 - Rotate through Russian kettlebell swings (15lb, 10lb); elevated, no push-up burpees; dumbbell push presses (8lb, 5lb); and modified lunges**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 4 - Rotate through Russian kettlebell swings (15lb, 10lb); elevated, no push-up burpees; dumbbell push presses (8lb, 5lb); and modified lunges**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 5 - Rotate through Russian kettlebell swings (15lb, 10lb); elevated, no push-up burpees; dumbbell push presses (8lb, 5lb); and modified lunges**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**Tabata 1 - Air bike for calories**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 2 - Rotate through Russian kettlebell swings (35lb, 22lb), step-back burpees, dumbbell push presses (25lb, 15lb), and alternating lunges**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 3 - Rotate through Russian kettlebell swings (35lb, 22lb), step-back burpees, dumbbell push presses (25lb, 15lb), and alternating lunges**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 4 - Rotate through Russian kettlebell swings (35lb, 22lb), step-back burpees, dumbbell push presses (25lb, 15lb), and alternating lunges**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 5 - Rotate through Russian kettlebell swings (35lb, 22lb), step-back burpees, dumbbell push presses (25lb, 15lb), and alternating lunges**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total number of repetitions you complete during today’s workout.
