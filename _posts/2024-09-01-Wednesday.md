[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Today’s workout is a 16 minute AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”). Your goal is to complete as many rounds of 10 lunges, 8 air squats, 6 ring rows, 4 push-ups, and 2 wall walks as you can in the 16 minute workout period. Everyone will be performing ring rows today, even our experienced community members. Remember, the more parallel you are to the floor, the more difficult the ring row. Make the appropriate adjustments so that the ring rows match your ability levels today. Work hard, and push for every last repetition!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**16 minute AMRAP:**

**10 alternating lunges**

**8 air squats**

**6 ring rows**

**4 push-up**

**2 wall walks**
<!--more-->

Beginners can scale the movements as needed. Please feel free to modify the lunges by using a handhold for stability or by not lowering your back knee all the way to the ground. Sit-to-stands can replace regular air squats, wall push-ups can replace regular push-ups, and inchworms can replace wall walks. Do what’s right for you today! A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**16 minute AMRAP:**

**10 modified lunges**

**8 air squats or sit-to-stands**

**6 ring rows**

**4 wall push-ups**

**2 inchworms**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**16 minute AMRAP:**

**10 alternating lunges**

**8 air squats**

**6 ring rows**

**4 kneeling push-ups or box push-ups**

**2 partial wall walks or box wall walks**

Your score is the total number of rounds and repetitions you complete during today’s workout.
