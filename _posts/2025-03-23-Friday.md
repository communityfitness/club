TGIF, Community Fitness Club! In today’s WOD (“Workout of the Day”), we will perform 20 burpees as a buy in; then we will complete 5 rounds of 20 kettlebell deadlifts, 10 sit-ups, and 5 handstand push-ups; and then we will finish with a buy out of 20 burpees. Push hard, and finish this one as quickly as you can!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**For time:**

**Buy in:**

**20 burpees**

**Then 5 rounds:**

**20 kettlebell deadlifts (71lb, 53lb)**

**10 abmat sit-ups**

**5 handstand push-ups**

**Buy out:**

**20 burpees**

Beginners can scale today’s workout by substituting dumbbell push presses for the handstand push-ups, by modifying the burpees and sit-ups, and by reducing the number of rounds and the kettlebell weight. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**For time:**

**Buy in:**

**20 elevated, no push-up burpees**

**Then 4 rounds:**

**20 kettlebell deadlifts (20lb, 15lb)**

**10 anchored or assisted sit-ups**

**5 dumbbell push presses (8lb, 5lb)**

**Buy out:**

**20 elevated, no push-up burpees**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**For time:**

**Buy in:**

**15 step-back burpees**

**Then 5 rounds:**

**20 kettlebell deadlifts (53lb, 35lb)**

**10 abmat sit-ups**

**5 box handstand push-ups or dumbbell push presses (35lb, 25lb)**

**Buy out:**

**15 step-back burpees**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
