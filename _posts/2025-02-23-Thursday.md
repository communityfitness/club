[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Today we will try to complete 6 rounds of 5 pull-ups,10 calories on the rower, and 20 squat jumps as quickly as possible. Remember, though, you can always scale the workouts to meet your current fitness level. Do your best, and that will be good enough!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**6 rounds for time:**

**5 pull-ups**

**10 calorie row**

**20 squat jumps**
<!--more-->

Beginners can scale the rep scheme and modify the movements in today’s workout. Ring rows can be substituted for the pull-ups, and half squat jumps or half squats can be substituted for the squat jumps. A half squat is performed like an air squat, but you simply don’t squat as low.  If you want, you can perform a small hop at the top of the half squat to transform it into a half squat jump. Check out the links at the bottom of the page for more information on how to perform these movements. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**6 rounds for time:**

**4 ring rows**

**8 calorie row**

**12 half squat jumps or half squats**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**6 rounds for time:**

**5 jumping or banded pull-ups**

**10 calorie row**

**15 squat jumps**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
