Today’s WOD consists of seven rounds of 10 burpees and 10 hang power cleans. Pick a weight for the hang power cleans that is moderately challenging but that you can perform with good form throughout the workout. Good luck out there!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**7 rounds for time:**

**10 burpees**

**10 hang power cleans (115lb, 75lb)**
<!--more-->

A beginner can modify the burpees and substitute dumbbell hang power cleans for hang power cleans with a barbell. It is also okay to reduce the number of rounds to make today’s workout more doable. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**6 rounds for time:**

**10 elevated, no push-up burpees**

**10 dumbbell hang power cleans (15lb, 8lb)**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**7 rounds for time:**

**10 step-back burpees**

**10 hang power cleans (75lb, 55lb)**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
