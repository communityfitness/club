[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Today on the 7th of May, we will complete a workout composed of 7 rounds of 7 box jumps, 7 handstand push-ups, 7 toes-to-bar, and 7 deadlifts. Though the goal is to finish as quickly as possible, please be careful! Be mindful of your form during the deadlifts, and be vigilant during the box jumps. Please prioritize safety over speed today. It’s okay to reduce the weight of the deadlifts, switch to a shorter box, or do box step-ups if you need to!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**7 rounds for time:**

**7 box jumps (24in., 20in.)**

**7 handstand push-ups**

**7 toes-to-bar**

**7 deadlifts (225lb, 155lb)**
<!--more-->

Please choose a box height that you feel comfortable with, and if jumping isn’t right for you today, perform box step-ups instead. You can also substitute seated dumbbell presses for handstand push-ups, toes-to-rig for toes-to-bar, and kettlebell deadlifts for regular deadlifts. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**7 rounds for time:**

**7 box jumps or 14 box step-ups to a comfortable height**

**7 seated dumbbell presses (8lb, 5lb)**

**7 toes-to-rig**

**7 kettlebell deadlifts (35lb, 22lb)**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**7 rounds for time:**

**7 box jumps to a comfortable height**

**7 box handstand push-ups or handstand kick-ups with a controlled descent**

**7 hanging leg raises**

**7 deadlifts (155lb, 115lb)**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
