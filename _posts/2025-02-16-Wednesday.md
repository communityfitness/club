[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Today’s workout contains only two movements: rowing and sit-ups. You will row 500 meters and perform 50 sit-ups, then a 400 meter row and 40 sit-ups, then a 300 meter row and 30 sit-ups, then a 200 meter row and 20 sit-ups, then finally a 100 meter row and 10 sit-ups. This WOD contains a high volume of sit-ups that not everyone will be able to complete. That’s okay! Scale to a number of sit-ups that is appropriate for you. You will still get in a good workout!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**For time:**

**500-400-300-200-100:**

**Meter row**

**50-40-30-20-10:**

**Abmat sit-ups**
<!--more-->

Beginners can reduce the total number of sit-ups performed. They can also modify the sit-ups as needed. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**For time:**

**500-400-300-200-100:**

**Meter row**

**25-20-15-10-5:**

**Anchored or assisted sit-ups**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**For time:**

**500-400-300-200-100:**

**Meter row**

**30-30-30-20-10:**

**Abmat sit-ups**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
