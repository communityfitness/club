Thank goodness it’s Friday! We will close out this week with a 16 minute AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”) in which we will perform as many rounds of 10 calories on the air bike, 10 dumbbell thrusters, 10 box jumps, and 20 Russian twists as we can until the 16 minutes up. 

I like ending the week with AMRAPs, because they scale to however you’re feeling that day. If you’re feeling tired after a long week of working out, take it a little slower today and perform each movement mindfully and purposefully. If you’re feeling strong, push hard and get in as many reps as possible! 

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**16 minute AMRAP:**

**10 calorie air bike**

**10 dumbbell thrusters (35lb, 25lb)**

**10 box jumps (24in., 20in.)**

**20 Russian twists with a dumbbell (35lb, 25lb)**
<!--more-->

AMRAPs scale automatically. A beginner will naturally perform fewer rounds and reps than an advanced athlete. However, it is often necessary to scale other aspects of the workout as well. Please feel free to reduce the weight of the dumbbells and the height of the box. You can also modify the rep scheme if that makes the workout more doable for you. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**16 minute AMRAP:**

**6 calorie air bike**

**6 dumbbell thrusters (5lb, 3lb) or sit-to-stands**

**6 box jumps or 12 box step-ups to a comfortable height**

**12 Russian twists (no dumbbell; heels on floor)**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**16 minute AMRAP:**

**8 calorie air bike**

**8 dumbbell thrusters (25lb, 15lb)**

**8 box jumps to a comfortable height**

**16 Russian twists with a dumbbell (25lb, 15lb)**

Your score is the total number of rounds and repetitions you complete during the AMRAP.
