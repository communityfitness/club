[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

It’s a brand new week, Community Fitness Club! We will begin the week with a 15 minute AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”). The goal today is to complete as many rounds of 12 dumbbell box step-ups, 9 dumbbell hang power cleans, 6 dumbbell push jerks, and 3 burpees as you can during the 15 minute workout period. Pick a dumbbell weight that allows you to keep moving today. Today’s WOD will really test your grip strength, so don’t be afraid to go a little lighter than usual.

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**12 dumbbell box step-ups (24in., 20in.), (50lb, 35lb)**

**9 dumbbell hang power cleans (50lb, 35lb)**

**6 dumbbell push jerks, (50lb, 35lb)**

**3 burpees**
<!--more-->
 

AMRAPs scale automatically. A beginner will naturally perform fewer repetitions than an advanced athlete, and that’s okay! However, it is often necessary to scale other aspects of the workout as well. Pick variations that are right for you today. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**12 dumbbell box step-ups to a comfortable height (8lb, 5lb)**

**9 dumbbell hang power cleans (8lb, 5lb)**

**6 dumbbell push jerks or push presses (8lb, 5lb)**

**3 elevated, no push-up burpees**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**12 dumbbell box step-ups to a comfortable height (30lb, 20lb)**

**9 dumbbell hang power cleans (30lb, 20lb)**

**6 dumbbell push jerks (30lb, 20lb)**

**3 step-back burpees**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.
