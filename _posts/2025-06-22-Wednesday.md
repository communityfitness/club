Today’s workout consists of five 2-minute AMRAPs (“As Many Reps As Possible”). That means that in each two minute period you will perform as many rounds of 3 burpees and 2 broad jumps as you can. Push hard! You will get one minute to recover between each round. 

To time today’s WOD using the SmartWOD timer:

(1) Press “TABATA”. 

(2) Choose 5 rounds of 2 minutes of work and 1 minutes of rest.

(3) Press “START TIMER”.

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**Five 2 minute AMRAPs in 14 minutes:**

**3 burpees**

**2 broad jumps**

***Rest 1 minutes***

Today’s WOD scales automatically. A beginner will naturally perform fewer reps than an advanced athlete. However, it may also be necessary to scale the movements. Modify the burpees and broad jumps to your current fitness level. Broad jumps can be modified by either jumping a shorter distance or by jumping with one foot leading instead of with both feet together. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**Five 2 minute AMRAPs in 14 minutes:**

**3 elevated, no push-up burpees**

**2 broad jumps or long jumps**

***Rest 1 minutes***

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**Five 2 minute AMRAPs in 14 minutes:**

**3 step-back burpees**

**2 broad jumps**

***Rest 1 minutes***

Your score is the total number of rounds and reps you complete during today’s workout.
