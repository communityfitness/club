[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up) 

It’s Monday, Community Fitness Club! Let’s get the week off to a great start with 4 rounds of 40 double unders, 20 kettlebell swings, 20 wall balls, and 20 sit-ups. Use the sit-ups to catch your breath so that you can push hard through the rest of the workout and finish as quickly as possible! It will be tough, but you can do it!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**4 rounds for time:**

**40 double unders**

**20 American kettlebell swings (53lb, 35lb)**

**20 wall balls (20lb, 14lb)**

**20 abmat sit-ups**
<!--more-->

Beginners can modify the rep scheme and scale the movements in today’s WOD. Imaginary jump rope or single unders can replace double unders. Russian kettlebell swings can be performed instead of American kettlebell swings, and anchored or assisted sit-ups can replace regular abmat sit-ups. Also, if wall balls are still hard for you, just focus on doing the best you can today. You don’t have to throw the ball really high or squat really low. Whatever you can do is good enough! A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**4 rounds for time:**

**40 imaginary jump rope or 20 single unders**

**15 Russian kettlebell swings (20lb, 15lb)**

**12 wall balls (10lb, 10lb) or dumbbell thrusters (5lb, 3lb) or sit-to-stands**

**9 anchored or assisted sit-ups**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**4 rounds for time:**

**20 double unders or 80 single unders**

**20 American kettlebell swings (35lb, 22lb)**

**20 wall balls (14lb, 10lb)**

**15 abmat sit-ups**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s WOD.
