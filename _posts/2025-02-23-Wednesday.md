For today’s WOD (“Workout of the Day”), we will complete a 15 minute AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”). The goal is to complete as many rounds of 30 double unders, 15 kettlebell deadlifts, 10 kettlebell swings, 10 kettlebell box step-ups, and 1 wall walk as you can during the 15 minute workout period.  Work hard! You can do it!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**30 double unders**

**15 kettlebell deadlifts (53lb, 35lb)**

**10 American kettlebell swings (53lb, 35lb)**

**10 box step-ups holding a kettlebell (53lb, 35lb), (24in., 20in.)**

**1 wall walk**
<!--more-->

AMRAPs scale automatically. A beginner will naturally perform fewer repetitions than an advanced athlete. However, this workout can be scaled in other ways as well. Single unders or imaginary jump rope can be performed instead of double unders, Russian kettlebell swings can be done instead of American kettlebell swings, and inchworms can be substituted for wall walks. Also, the kettlebell weight can be reduced, and the box height can be lowered. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**14 minute AMRAP:**

**15 single unders or 30 imaginary jump rope**

**15 kettlebell deadlifts (20lb, 15lb)**

**10 Russian kettlebell swings (20lb, 15lb)**

**10 box step-ups to a comfortable height holding a kettlebell (20lb, 15lb)**

**2 inchworms**

And here is another version. Mix and match to find what is right for you!

**Scaled 2:**

**14 minute AMRAP:**

**15 double unders or 60 single unders**

**15 kettlebell deadlifts (35b, 22lb)**

**10 American kettlebell swings (35b, 22lb)**

**10 box step-ups to a comfortable height holding a kettlebell (35b, 22lb)**

**1 partial wall walk or 2 inchworm push-ups**

Your score is the total number of rounds and repetitions you complete during today’s workout.
