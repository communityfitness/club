[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up) 

Yesterday was tough! Let’s recover a bit with a 21 minute EMOM (“Every Minute On the Minute”) in which we will row for as many calories as possible during the first minute, perform as many sit-ups as we can during the second minute, and rest during the third minute. This will continue for 7 rounds until the 21 minutes are complete. Remember, if you’re feeling exceptionally tired or sore after yesterday, you can take it a little slower today. Just do your best! 

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**21 minute EMOM:**

**Minute 1: Max calorie row**

**Minute 2: Max abmat sit-ups**

**Minute 3: Rest**
<!--more-->

Today’s WOD scales automatically. Less experienced athletes will naturally perform fewer repetitions than advanced athletes, and that’s okay!  A scaled version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled:**

**21 minute EMOM:**

**Minute 1: Max calorie row**

**Minute 2: Max anchored or assisted sit-ups**

**Minute 3: Rest**

Your score is the total number of rowing calories and sit-ups you accumulate during today’s workout.
