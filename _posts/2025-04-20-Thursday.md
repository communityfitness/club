Today’s WOD (“Workout of the Day”) only has two movements, kettlebell swings and rowing, but it will still be challenging to complete! You will perform 2 rounds of 25 Russian kettlebell swings and a 25 calorie row, then 20 Russian kettlebell swings and a 20 calorie row, then 15 Russian kettlebell swings and a 15 calorie row, then 10 Russian kettlebell swings and a 10 calorie row, then finally 5 Russian kettlebell swings and a 5 calorie row. It will be mentally and physically challenging to start back up at 25 repetitions after making it all the way down to 5 repetitions at the beginning of the second round, but you can do it. Dig deep, and get through it!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:
