[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Today’s WOD consists of all body weight movements with 8 rounds of 5 pull-ups, 10 sit-ups, 20 lunges, and 2 wall walks. Today, think about keeping an eye on the clock and trying to pace yourself. Though we all inevitably slow some as the workout progresses, try to keep the time for each round as consistent as possible.

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**8 rounds for time:**

**5 pull-ups**

**10 abmat sit-ups**

**20 alternating lunges**

**2 wall walks**
<!--more-->

Beginners can reduce the number of rounds, scale the rep scheme, and modify the movements. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**6 rounds for time:**

**5 ring rows**

**8 anchored or assisted sit-ups**

**12 modified lunges**

**3 inchworms**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**8 rounds for time:**

**5 jumping or banded pull-ups**

**10 abmat sit-ups**

**20 alternating lunges**

**2 partial wall walks or 4 inchworm push-ups**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
