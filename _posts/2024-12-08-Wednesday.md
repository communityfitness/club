[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

The two movements in today’s couplet are deadlifts and burpees. In seven 2-minute intervals, you will perform 5 deadlifts followed by as many burpees as possible. You will then have one minute to rest before beginning the next round. Try to pace yourself during the early rounds. You don’t want to go so hard on the first round that you burn yourself out for the rest of the workout!

Please err on the side of caution when choosing which weight to use for the deadlifts. It is easy to hurt yourself if you perform deadlifts incorrectly, and we all want to be in top form for the upcoming holiday season!

To time today’s workout using the SmartWOD app, use the following steps:

(1)Press “TABATA”.

(2)Choose 7 rounds of 2:00 work and 1:00 rest.

(3) Press “START TIMER”.

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**Seven 2-minute rounds for max burpees:**

**5 deadlifts (225lb, 155lb)**

**Max effort burpees**

***Rest 1 minute between rounds***

A beginner can scale today’s WOD by performing kettlebell deadlifts rather than barbell deadlifts and by modifying the burpees. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**Seven 2-minute rounds for max burpees:**

**8 kettlebell deadlifts (35lb, 22lb)**

**Max effort elevated, no push-up burpees**

***Rest 1 minute between rounds***

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**Seven 2-minute rounds for max burpees:**

**5 deadlifts (115lb, 95lb)**

**Max effort step-back burpees**

***Rest 1 minute between rounds***

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total number of burpees you complete during today’s workout.
