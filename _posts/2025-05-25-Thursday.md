Today’s WOD is another AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”).  For 15 minutes, you will complete as many rounds of 14 Russian kettlebell swings, 6 box jump overs, and 14 alternating lunges as you can. If you’re feeling recovered after “Murph” on Monday push hard and get in as many rounds and reps as possible. Otherwise, scale the workout by using a lighter kettlebell, jumping onto a shorter box, or by moving a little slower. It’s important to listen to your body and do what’s right for you today!

Notice that the kettlebell swings are Russian, that is swung to eye level. If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD: 

**Experienced:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**14 Russian kettlebell swings (53lb, 35lb)**

**6 box jump overs (24in., 20in.)**

**14 alternating lunges**
<!--more-->

Beginners, please pick a kettlebell weight that you can perform safely and that you can swing with good form. Also, if you don’t feel up for jumping today, consider substituting box step-ups for the box jump overs. You can hold onto your kettlebell during these step-ups for added difficulty or perform them with your body weight only. Choose the option that is right for you today! A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**10 Russian kettlebell swings (20lb, 15lb)**

**6 box jump overs or box step-ups to a comfortable height**

**10 modified lunges**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**14 Russian kettlebell swings (35lb, 22lb)**

**6 box jump overs to a comfortable height**

**14 alternating lunges**

Your score is the total number of rounds and reps you complete during today’s workout.
