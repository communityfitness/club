Valentine’s Day is this Friday, Community Fitness Club! Let’s get ready with a workout called “Valentine’s Gone Bad” in which you will perform three rounds of five different movements–mountain climbers, dumbbell box step-ups, inchworm push-ups, high knees, and rowing for calories–for one minute each. After the fifth station of each round, you will take a one minute break. 

If you are using the Smart WOD timer, you can use the EMOM feature to time today’s workout. Simply select “EMOM” and then choose “Every 1 for 17.” Please remember, though, that unlike in an EMOM, there is no set number of repetitions to perform each minute. The goal is to accumulate as many total repetitions as you can. Pace yourself. That third round will be tough! 

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

***Valentine’s Gone Bad***

**Experienced:**

**3 rounds for total reps in 17 minutes:**

**1 minute of mountain climbers**

**1 minute of dumbbell box step-ups (35lb, 25lb), (24in., 20in.)**

**1 minute of inchworm push-ups**

**1 minute of high knees**

**1 minute of row for calories**

**1 minute of rest**
<!--more-->

Beginners generally go slower and perform fewer repetitions per round than experienced athletes. However, they should also feel free to modify the exercises as needed. Please use a weight and box height that is safe for you, and feel free to substitute inchworms for inchworm push-ups. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**3 rounds for total reps in 17 minutes:**

**1 minute of mountain climbers**

**1 minute of dumbbell box step-ups to a comfortable height (10lb, 5lb)**

**1 minute of inchworms**

**1 minute of high knees or march-in-place**

**1 minute of row for calories**

**1 minute of rest**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**3 rounds for total reps in 17 minutes:**

**1 minute of mountain climbers**

**1 minute of dumbbell box step-ups to a comfortable height (20lb, 15lb)**

**1 minute of inchworms to kneeling push-ups**

**1 minute of high knees**

**1 minute of row for calories**

**1 minute of rest**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total number of reps you complete during the 17 minutes. For the row, 1 calorie counts as 1 rep.
