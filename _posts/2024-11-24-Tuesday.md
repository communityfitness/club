[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

In today’s workout, we’re going to visit three of the “girls” we’ve met in some of our past benchmark workouts: Jackie, Christine, and Cindy. It might be helpful to look back on how you scaled these workouts in the past when choosing scaling options for today’s WOD.

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD. Note that I suggest performing dumbbell thrusters during the Jackie portion of the workout, so that you don’t have to add plates to the barbell to perform the deadlifts in the next section. If you want to perform barbell thrusters, lay out the plates you’ll need for the deadlifts to make the transition between the girls’ houses quicker and easier.

***Thanksgiving with the Girls***

**Experienced:**

**For time:**

Beginners should modify the movements to make today’s workout more doable. Also, feel free to shorten the rowing distance if the given distance seems too overwhelming. 

**Scaled 1:**

**For time:**

***Jackie’s house:***

**400m row**

**20 dumbbell thrusters (5lb, 3lb) or air squats or sit-to-stands**

**12 ring rows**

***Christine’s house:***

**500m row**

**12 kettlebell deadlifts (35lb, 22lb)**

**21 box jumps to a comfortable height**

***Cindy’s house:***

**2 rounds:**

**5 ring rows**

**10 wall push-ups**

**15 air squats or sit-to-stands**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**For time:**

***Jackie’s house:***

**400m row**

**20 dumbbell thrusters (15lb, 10lb)**

**12 jumping pull-ups or banded pull-ups**

***Christine’s house:***

**500m row**

**12 deadlifts (115lb, 85lb)**

**21 box jumps to a comfortable height**

***Cindy’s house:***

**2 rounds:**

**5 jumping pull-ups or banded pull-ups**

**10 box push-ups or kneeling push-ups**

**15 air squats**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
