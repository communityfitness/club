[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Today’s workout will be fun but challenging! Every 2 minutes for 16 minutes, we will perform 10 ring rows, 10 push-ups, and 10 squat jumps, and then we will perform as many kettlebell swings as possible in the remaining time. Don’t push too hard in the beginning. Pace yourself, so that you still have something to give at the end. 

You can use the SmartWOD timer app to time today’s workout. Simply press “EMOM,” then choose “Every 2 for 16” and press “Start Timer.” 

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**Every 2 minutes for 16 minutes:**

**10 ring rows**

**10 push-ups**

**10 squat jumps**

**Then max effort American kettlebell swings (53lb, 35lb)**

Beginning athletes can shorten today’s workout and modify the movements. Do what works for you! A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**Every 2 minutes for 14 minutes:**

**5 ring rows**

**8 wall push-ups**

**8 air squats or sit-to-stands**

**Then max effort Russian kettlebell swings (20lb, 15lb)**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**Every 2 minutes for 16 minutes:**

**8 ring rows**

**5 push-ups or 10 kneeling push-ups**

**10 squat jumps**

**Then max effort American kettlebell swings (35lb, 22lb)**

Your score is the total number of calories you row during the 20 minute E2MOM.
