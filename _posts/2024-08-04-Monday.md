Happy Monday, Community Fitness Club! I hope you are enjoying your August so far! Let’s kick this week off by completing a workout consisting of six rounds of pull-ups, kettlebell swings, and rowing. Today’s workout is on the longer side, so if you are strapped for time feel free to set a time cap and get in as much of the workout as you can. Remember, the goal is to do _something_. You don’t have to do _everything_.

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**6 rounds for time:**

**8 pull-ups**

**20 Russian kettlebell swings (53lb, 35lb)**

**400 meter row**
<!--more-->

Beginners can modify the movements in today’s workout and shorten the row. Even scaled, today’s WOD is a lot of work. By the time you finish this version of the workout, you will have done 36 ring rows, 90 Russian kettlebell swings, and rowed a little over a mile!

**Scaled 1:**

**6 rounds for time:**

**6 ring rows**

**15 Russian kettlebell swings (20lb, 15lb)**

**300 meter row**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**6 rounds for time:**

**8 jumping or banded pull-ups or 4 regular pull-ups**

**20 Russian kettlebell swings (35lb, 22lb)**

**400 meter row**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult. Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
