[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up) 

Today’s workout is a 12 minute AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”). The goal is to perform as many rounds of 5 pull-ups, 6 up and down planks, 7 box jumps, and 8 abmat sit-ups as you can in 12 minutes. Though the goal is to move quickly, please be careful on the box jumps. Pick a height and pace that you can perform safely, and switch to box step-ups if needed. Work hard, but stay safe as well!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**12 minute AMRAP:**

**5 pull-ups**

**6 up and down planks**

**7 box jumps (24in., 20in.)**

**8 abmat sit-ups**
<!--more-->

AMRAPs scale automatically, since a beginner will naturally perform fewer reps than an advanced athlete. However, beginners can make other modifications as well. You can substitute ring rows for pull-ups, a plank hold for up and down planks, and modify the box jumps and sit-ups as needed. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**12 minute AMRAP:**

**4 ring rows**

**15 second plank hold**

**6 box jumps or box step-ups to a comfortable height**

**7 anchored or assisted sit-ups**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**12 minute AMRAP:**

**5 jumping or banded pull-ups**

**6 up and down planks**

**7 box jumps to a comfortable height**

**8 abmat sit-ups**

Your score is the total number or rounds and repetitions you complete during today’s 12 minute workout.
