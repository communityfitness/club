Thank goodness it’s Friday! We will finish the week with a 12 minute AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”) in which we will perform as many rounds of 3 toes-to-bar, 6 deadlifts, and 3 hang power cleans as possible. Pick a weight for your barbell where you can perform the deadlifts and hang power cleans unbroken for most of the workout. When you are done, take the time to [stretch](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/stretching) out. Mobility is a very important part of fitness!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**12 minute AMRAP:**

**3 toes-to-bar**

**6 deadlifts (125lb, 85lb)**

**3 hang power cleans (125lb, 85lb)**
<!--more-->

Beginners can substitute dumbbell deadlifts and dumbbell hang power cleans for their barbell counterparts, and toes-to-rig can be performed instead of toes-to-bar. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**12 minute AMRAP:**

**3 toes-to-rig**

**6 dumbbell deadlifts (12lb, 8lb)**

**3 dumbbell hang power cleans (12lb, 8lb)**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**12 minute AMRAP:**

**3 hanging knee raises**

**6 deadlifts (75lb, 55lb)**

**3 hang power cleans (75lb, 55lb)**

Remember to [stretch](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/stretching) when you’re finished!

Your score is the total number of rounds and repetitions you complete during today’s workout.
