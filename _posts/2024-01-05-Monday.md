[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

It’s Monday, Community Fitness Club! Let’s kick off our week with a multi-part workout containing thrusters, wall balls, rowing, burpees, and pull-ups. The first part of our workout will begin with 12 thrusters and 12 burpee pull-ups, followed by 9 thrusters and 9 burpee pull-ups, then 6 thrusters and 6 burpee pull-ups. We will then move on to 12 wall balls and 12 pull-ups, 9 wall balls and 9 pull-ups, and then 6 wall balls and 6 pull-ups. Finally, we will finish with a 12 calorie row and 12 burpees, a 9 calorie row and 9 burpees, then a 6 calorie row and 6 burpees. Try to keep a nice, steady pace through today’s workout by not going out too hard at the beginning and by taking short breaks throughout. You can do it!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**For time:**

**12-9-6 reps:**

**Thrusters (95lb, 65lb)**

Beginners can scale the rep scheme in today’s workout. The thrusters and wall balls can also be scaled in many ways. If thrusters with a barbell aren’t your thing, consider substituting dumbbell thrusters, air squats, or sit-to-stands. If you struggle with wall balls, you can perform wall ball goblet squats or sit-to-stands instead. Beginners can also substitute ring rows for pull-ups and can modify the burpees. Pick what works for you! A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**For time:**

**9-6-3 reps:**

**Dumbbell thrusters (5lb, 3lb), air squats, or sit-to-stands**

**Elevated, no push-up burpees**

**Ring rows**

**Then 9-6-3 reps:**

**Wall balls, wall ball goblet squats, or sit-to-stands**

**Ring rows**

**Then 9-6-3 reps:**

**Calorie row**

**Elevated, no push-up burpees**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**For time:**

**12-9-6 reps:**

**Thrusters (65lb, 45lb)**

**Burpee jumping pull-ups**

**Then 12-9-6 reps:**

**Wall balls (14lb, 10lb)**

**Banded or jumping pull-ups**

**Then 12-9-6 reps:**

**Calorie row**

**Burpees**
