It’s the last day of March, Community Fitness Club! Let’s see the month out with an AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”) in which you will complete as many rounds of 12 wall balls and 12 box jumps as you can during the 12 minute workout period. Both of these movements will get more and more challenging as the workout progresses, so please modify the workout appropriately. Pick scaling options that allow you to keep moving throughout the workout with minimal rest, and switch to a lower box or box step-ups if your box jumps start to get shaky!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**12 minute AMRAP:**

**12 wall balls (20lb, 14lb)**

**12 box jumps (24in., 20in.)**
<!--more-->

Beginning athletes can scale today’s WOD by reducing the number of repetitions per round and by modifying the movements. You can scale the wall balls by substituting dumbbell thrusters, air squats, or sit-to-stands. You can scale the box jumps by reducing the height of the box or by substituting box step-ups. Pick the options that work for you! A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**12 minute AMRAP:**

**8 dumbbell thrusters (5lb, 3lb) or air squats or sit-to-stands**

**8 box jumps or box step-ups to a comfortable height**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**12 minute AMRAP:**

**10 wall balls (14lb, 10lb)**

**10 box jumps to a comfortable height**

Your score is the total number of rounds and repetitions you complete during today’s workout.
