[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up) 

Today we will keep things simple by doing a tabata-style workout. In a tabata, you perform a given movement for 8 rounds of 20 seconds of work and 10 seconds of rest. 

In the first tabata of today’s WOD, we will cycle through each scale variation twice. That is, we will perform a front scale on our left foot for 20 seconds, then a front scale on our right foot for 20 seconds, then a back scale on our left foot for 20 seconds, then a back scale on our right foot for 20 seconds. We will then repeat all four movements one more time. 

The next four tabatas will consist of dumbbell box step-ups, mountain climbers, pull-ups, and handstand push-ups.

To time today’s workout using the SmartWOD timer app: 

1. Select “TABATA”. 
2. Choose 8 rounds of 0:20 work, 0:10 rest.
3. Press the plus sign beside “Add sets (optional)”.
4. Coose 5 sets with 1 minute of rest between sets. 
5. Press “START TIMER”.

You can also use “tabata songs” on YouTube to time your workout. Check out the link on how to time your workout at the bottom of this post for more information.

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**Tabata 1 - Scales (front left, front right, back left, back right)**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 2 - Alternate between dumbbell box step-ups (35lb, 25lb), (24in., 20in.) and mountain climbers**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 3 - Alternate between dumbbell box step-ups (35lb, 25lb), (24in., 20in.) and mountain climbers**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 4 - Alternate between pull-ups and handstand push-ups**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 5 - Alternate between pull-ups and handstand push-ups**

Tabatas scale automatically. A beginner will naturally perform fewer repetitions than an advanced athlete. That’s okay! Also feel free to scale the movements as needed. Ring rows can replace pull-ups and dumbbell push presses can replace handstand push-ups. Just do what you can do today! A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**Tabata 1 - Scales (front left, front right, back left, back right)**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 2 - Alternate between dumbbell box step-ups to a comfortable height (12lb, 8lb) and mountain climbers**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 3 - Alternate between dumbbell box step-ups to a comfortable height (12lb, 8lb) and mountain climbers**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 4 - Alternate between ring rows and dumbbell push presses (8lb, 5lb)**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 4 - Alternate between ring rows and dumbbell push presses (8lb, 5lb)**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**Tabata 1 - Scales (front left, front right, back left, back right)**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 2 - Alternate between dumbbell box step-ups to a comfortable height (25lb, 15lb) and mountain climbers**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 3 - Alternate between dumbbell box step-ups to a comfortable height (25lb, 15lb) and mountain climbers**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 4 - Alternate between jumping or banded pull-ups and box handstand push-ups or dumbbell push presses (30lb, 20lb)**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 5 - Alternate between jumping or banded pull-ups and box handstand push-ups or dumbbell push presses (30lb, 20lb)**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.
