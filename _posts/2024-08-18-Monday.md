[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

We will begin the week with a 15 minute AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”) containing pull-ups, burpees, and wall ball squat cleans. These movements will really spike your heart rate, so your challenge will be managing that while pushing to complete as many rounds and repetitions as you can. Try to set a reasonable pace from the beginning, and keep your breaks short. You can do it!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**5 pull-ups**

**5 burpees**

**10 wall ball squat cleans (20lb, 14lb)**

**5 burpees**
<!--more-->

Beginners please modify today’s workout as needed. Ring rows can be substituted for the pull-ups, goblet squats can be substituted for the squat cleans, and the burpees can be modified. The rep scheme can also be scaled. Just do your best! A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**4 ring rows**

**4 elevated, no push-up burpees**

**8 wall ball goblet squats or air squats or sit-to-stands**

**4 elevated, no push-up burpees**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**5 jumping or band assisted pull-ups**

**5 step-back burpees**

**10 wall ball squat cleans (14lb, 10lb)**

**5 step-back burpees**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total number of rounds and repetitions you complete during today’s workout.
