[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Today we will do a tabata-style workout. In a tabata, you perform a given movement for 8 rounds of 20 seconds of work and 10 seconds of rest. 

In the first tabata of today’s WOD, you will cycle through each scale variation twice. That is, you will perform a front scale on your left foot for 20 seconds, then a front scale on your right foot for 20 seconds, then a back scale on your left foot for 20 seconds, then a back scale on your right foot for 20 seconds. You will then repeat all four movements one more time. 

In the second tabata of today’s WOD, you will alternate between performing 20 seconds of burpees and 20 seconds of broad jumps. In the third tabata, you will alternate between performing 20 seconds of sit-ups and 20 seconds of Superman hold. In the fourth tabata, you will alternate between performing 20 seconds of kettlebell swings and 20 seconds of kettlebell box step-ups. And in the fifth and final tabata, you will alternate between performing 20 seconds of kettlebell swings and 20 seconds of kettlebell box step-ups again. You will rest 1 minute between each tabata.

Tabatas scale automatically. A beginner will naturally perform fewer reps or hold movements for less time than an advanced athlete. It is also okay to modify the movements as needed. For instance, instead of performing broad jumps with both legs together, it’s okay to leap with one leg forward instead today. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**Tabata 1 - scales (front left, front right, back left, back right)**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 2 - alternate between elevated, no push-up burpees and leaps**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 3 - alternate between anchored or assisted sit-ups and Superman holds**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 4 - alternate between between Russian kettlebell swings (20lb, 15lb) and kettlebell box step-ups to a comfortable height**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 5 - alternate between between Russian kettlebell swings (20lb, 15lb) and kettlebell box step-ups to a comfortable height**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**Tabata 1 - scales (front left, front right, back left, back right)**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 2 - alternate between step-back burpees and broad jumps**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 3 - alternate between abmat sit-ups and Superman holds**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 4 - alternate between American kettlebell swings (35lb, 22lb) and kettlebell box step-us to a comfortable height**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 5 - alternate between American kettlebell swings (35lb, 22lb) and kettlebell box step-us to a comfortable height**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.
