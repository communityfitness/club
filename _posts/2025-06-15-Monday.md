[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

It’s Monday, Community Fitness Club! Let’s start our week with a fun AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”)! Today you will complete as many rounds of 4 dumbbell thrusters and 4 burpee box jump overs as you can in 16 minutes. You will be moving quickly as you complete today’s WOD, but please be careful on the box jumps. It is easy to trip and injure yourself as you get tired, so switch to box step-ups if you need to!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:
**Experienced:**

**16 minute AMRAP:**

**4 dumbbell thrusters (50lb, 35lb)**

**4 burpee box jump overs (24in., 20in.)**
<!--more-->

If dumbbell thrusters aren’t right for you today, you can do air squats or sit-to-stands instead. Beginners can also modify the burpees and reduce the height of the box jumps. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**16 minute AMRAP:**

**4 dumbbell thrusters (5lb, 3lb), air squats, or sit-to-stands**

**4 elevated, no push-up burpees**

**4 box jumps or box step-ups to a comfortable height**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**16 minute AMRAP:**

**4 dumbbell thrusters (35lb, 25lb)**

**4 step-back burpee box jump overs to a comfortable height**

Your score is the total number of rounds and repetitions you complete during today’s workout.
