[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up) 

Today’s workout is a 14 minute AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”). Try to complete as many rounds of 10/8 calories on the air bike, 10 deadlifts, 5 hang power cleans, and 1 wall walk as you can during the 14 minute work period. Modify the movements and weights as needed so that you can keep moving steadily through the WOD. As always, though, be careful. Even though the goal is to perform as many repetitions as possible, it is better to be slow and safe than fast and injured!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**14 minute AMRAP:**

**10/8 calorie air bike**

**10 deadlifts (115lb, 75lb)**

**5 hang power cleans (115lb, 75lb)**

**1 wall walk**
<!--more-->

Beginners can reduce the number of air bike calories in the workout, substitute dumbbell deadlifts and dumbbell hang power cleans for their barbell equivalents, and perform inchworms instead of wall walks. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**14 minute AMRAP:**

**8/6 calorie air bike**

**8 dumbbell deadlifts (12lb, 8lb)**

**4 dumbbell hang power cleans (12lb, 8lb)**

**2 inchworms**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**14 minute AMRAP:**

**10/8 calorie air bike**

**10 deadlifts (75lb, 55lb)**

**5 hang power cleans (75lb, 55lb)**

**1 partial wall walk or 2 inchworm push-ups**

Your score is the total number of rounds and reps you complete during the 16 minute AMRAP.
