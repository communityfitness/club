[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Today’s workout is a 14 minute AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”) in which we will complete as many rounds of 24 mountain climbers, 12 box step-ups, 6 pull-ups, and 3 toes-to-bar as we can during the 14 minute work period. For a fun challenge, try stringing your pull-ups and toes-to-bar together without dropping down off of the bar!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**14 minute AMRAP:**

**24 mountain climbers**

**12 box step-ups (24in., 20in.)**

**6 pull-ups**

**3 toes-to-bar**
<!--more-->

Beginners can substitute elevated mountain climbers for regular mountain climbers and ring rows for pull-ups. The box step-ups can also be performed on a shorter box and toes-to-wall or toes-to-rig can replace the toes-to-bar. Make the changes that are right for you today! A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**14 minute AMRAP:**

**24 elevated mountain climbers**

**12 box step-ups to a comfortable height**

**4 ring rows**

**4 toes-to-rig**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**14 minute AMRAP:**

**24 mountain climbers**

**12 box step-ups to a comfortable height**

**6 jumping pull-ups**

**3 hanging leg raises**

Your score is the total number of rounds and reps you complete during the 14 minute AMRAP.
