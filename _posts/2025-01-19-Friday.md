[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

TGIF, Community Fitness Club! In our last workout of the week, we will perform a buy-in of 10 power cleans, followed by a descending ladder of wall ball squat cleans, push-ups, and box jumps. That is, after we finish our 10 power cleans, we will perform 10 wall ball squat cleans, 10 push-ups, and 10 box jumps; followed by 9 wall ball squat cleans, 9 push-ups, and 9 box jumps; followed by 8 wall ball squat cleans, 8 push-ups, and 8 box jumps; and so on until we finish with 1 wall ball squat clean, 1 push-up, and 1 box jump. Work hard out there today, and then go enjoy your weekend. You’ve earned it!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**For time:**

**Buy in: 10 power cleans (125lb, 85lb)**

**Then 10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1:**

**Wall ball squat cleans (20lb, 14lb)**

**Push-ups**

**Box jumps (24in., 20in.)**

Many beginners struggle with the movements in today’s WOD. That’s okay! You can substitute dumbbell power cleans for barbell power cleans, wall ball goblet squats or sit-to-stands for wall ball squat cleans, wall push-ups for regular push-ups, and box step-ups for box jumps. Never feel bad about modifying a workout. Doing something is always better than doing nothing! A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**For time:**

**10 dumbbell power cleans (8lb, 5lb)**

**Then 9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1:**

**Wall ball squat cleans, wall ball goblet squats, or sit-to-stands**

**Wall push-ups**

**Box jumps or box step-ups to a comfortable height**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**For time:**

**10 power cleans (95lb, 65lb)**

**Then 10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1:**

**Wall ball squat cleans (14lb, 10lb)**

**Kneeling push-ups or box push-ups**

**Box jumps to a comfortable height**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
