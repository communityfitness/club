I’m calling today’s workout *The Walking Deadlift*, and while it might not make you feel like one of the walking dead, the combination of deadlifts and lunges will give your back and backside a great workout! 

*The Walking Deadlift* is an EMOM (“Every Minute on the Minute”). In today’s workout, you will perform 10 deadlifts in the first minute and 20 walking lunges in the second minute. This will continue for 6 rounds until the 12 minutes are up. If you finish a movement before the given minute is complete, rest and wait until the next minute to begin the next movement.

If you are an experienced athlete, please perform the following WOD:

***The Walking Deadlift***

**Experienced:**

**12 minute EMOM:**

**Minute 1: 10 deadlifts (225lb, 155lb)**

**Minute 2: 20 dumbbell overhead walking lunges (35lb, 25lb)**
<!--more-->

A beginner can scale both the movements and the number of repetitions in each minute. Scale to a number of reps that you can complete in 45 seconds or less. This way you have at least 15 seconds to rest before transitioning to the next movement. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**12 minute EMOM:**

**Minute 1: 10 kettlebell deadlifts (35lb, 22lb)**

**Minute 2: 12 modified lunges**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**12 minute EMOM:**

**Minute 1: 10 deadlifts (105lb, 85lb)**

**Minute 2: 20 dumbbell walking lunges (25lb, 15lb)**

Your score is the total number of reps you complete during today’s workout.
