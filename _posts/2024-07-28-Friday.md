[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

TGIF, Community Fitness Club! We will finish the week with a tabata style workout. In a tabata, you perform a given movement for eight rounds of 20 seconds of work and 10 seconds of rest.

In the first tabata of today’s WOD, you will cycle through each scale variation twice. (Perform a front scale on your left foot for 20 seconds, then a front scale on your right foot for 20 seconds. Perform a back scale on your left foot for 20 seconds, then a back scale on your right foot for 20 seconds. Repeat all four movements one more time.)

In the next four tabatas you will cycle through riding on the air bike, push-ups, Superman hold, and box step-ups. That means that for each tabata you will perform 20 seconds of air bike, then 20 seconds of push-ups, then 20 seconds of Superman hold, then 20 seconds of box step-ups, then 20 more seconds of air bike, then 20 more seconds of push-ups, then 20 more seconds of Superman hold, then 20 more seconds box step-ups. You will rest for 90 seconds between each tabata.

To time today’s workout using the SmartWOD timer app:

(1) Press “TABATA”.

(2) Select 8 rounds of 0:20 work, 0:10 rest.

(3) Click on the plus sign beside “Add sets”.

(4) Select 5 sets with 1:30 minutes of rest between sets.

(5) Press "START TIMER".

Since tabatas scale automatically, everyone will complete the same workout today. Simply modify the movements as needed. You can perform regular push-ups, kneeling push-ups, or wall push-ups. You can hold the Superman hold for less than 20 seconds, and you can reduce the height of the box step-ups. Just do what works for you!
