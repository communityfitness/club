Today’s WOD (“Workout of the Day”) contains 3 rounds of 30 dumbbell thrusters and a 700 meter row. Both of these movements are great full-body exercises. Try to keep a steady pace throughout today’s workout. Pick a weight for the dumbbell thrusters that allows you to complete large sets. With the right weight, you should be able to complete the first round in no more than two sets. Don’t go too heavy, and don’t go out too fast. Pacing is the name of the game for today’s workout!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**3 rounds for time:**

**30 dumbbell thrusters (35lb, 25lb)**

**700 meter row**
<!--more-->

Beginners can modify the rep scheme of today’s workout and substitute air squats or sit-to-stands for the dumbbell thrusters if needed. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**4 rounds for time:**

**15 dumbbell thrusters (5lb, 3lb) or air squats or sit-to-stands**

**500 meter row**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**3 rounds for time:**

**25 dumbbell thrusters (25lb, 15lb)**

**700 meter row**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
