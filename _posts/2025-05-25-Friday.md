We will end the week with a workout that is both physically and mentally challenging. In four 3-minute intervals, you will perform 25 burpees followed by as many double unders as possible. You will then rest for two minutes before beginning the next round. Try to pick a number of burpees that allows you to spend at least 30 seconds and preferably 1 minute or more jumping rope each round.

To time today’s workout using the SmartWOD timer app, use the following steps:

1. Press “TABATA”.
2. Choose 4 rounds of 3:00 work and 2:00 rest.
3. Press “START TIMER”.

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**Four 3-minute rounds for max double unders:**

**25 burpees**

**Max effort double unders**

****Rest 2 minutes between rounds***

You can scale today’s WOD by modifying the burpees and by substituting single unders or imaginary jump rope for the double unders. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**Four 3-minute rounds for max single unders:**

**20 elevated, no push-up burpees**

**Max effort single unders or imaginary jump rope**

****Rest 2 minutes between rounds***

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**Four 3-minute rounds for max double unders or single unders:**

**20 step-back burpees**

**Max effort double unders or single unders**

****Rest 2 minutes between rounds***

Your score is the total number of double unders you accumulate during today’s workout.
