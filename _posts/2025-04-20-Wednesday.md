Today’s WOD (“Workout of the Day”) is a “Fight Gone Bad” style workout. You will perform three one-minute rounds of five different movements: kettlebell deadlifts, double unders, push-ups, box step-ups, and inchworms. After the fifth exercise, you will rest for one minute. If you are using the Smart WOD timer app, you can use the EMOM feature set to 17 minutes to time today’s workout. Pace yourself. That third round will be tough! 

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**3 rounds for total reps in 17 minutes:**

**1 minute kettlebell deadlifts (71lb, 53lb)**

**1 minute double unders**

**1 minute push-ups**

**1 minute box step-ups (24in., 20in.)**

**1 minute inchworms**

**1 minute rest**
<!--more-->

Like with an AMRAP, beginners will naturally perform fewer reps than an advanced athlete. That’s okay! Take breaks as needed, and scale the movements to something doable for you today. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**3 rounds for total reps in 17 minutes:**

**1 minute kettlebell deadlifts (20lb, 15lb)**

**1 minute single unders or imaginary jump rope**

**1 minute wall push-ups**

**1 minute box step-ups to a comfortable height**

**1 minute inchworms**

**1 minute rest**

Today would be a good day to practice your double unders, and it’s perfectly acceptable if you only manage to get a couple in each round. I promise they will get easier with practice! Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**3 rounds for total reps in 17 minutes:**

**1 minute kettlebell deadlifts (53lb, 35lb)**

**1 minute double unders or single unders**

**1 minute box push-ups or kneeling push-ups**

**1 minute box step-ups to a comfortable height**

**1 minute inchworms**

**1 minute rest**

Your score is the total number of repetitions you complete in the 17 minutes.
