[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up) 

It’s Monday, Community Fitness Club! We will kick off the week with 10 rounds of 10 kettlebell goblet squats, 15 kettlebell swings, and 20 double unders. You should be able to move through each round quickly, so be thoughtful when picking your scaling options. This might mean using a lighter weight kettlebell, performing Russian kettlebell swings instead of American kettlebell swings, scaling the number of repetitions per round, or substituting single unders for double unders. Do what works for you today!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**10 rounds for time:**

**10 kettlebell goblet squats (53lb, 35lb)**

**15 American kettlebell swings (53lb, 35lb)**

**20 double unders**
<!--more-->

Beginners can substitute Russian kettlebell swings for American kettlebell swings and single unders or imaginary jump rope for double unders. If goblet squats aren’t your thing, you can do air squats or sit-to-stands instead. Also feel free to reduce the number of repetitions performed each round to an amount that feels doable for you. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**10 rounds for time:**

**8 kettlebell goblet squats (15lb, 10lb), air squats, or sit-to-stands**

**12 Russian kettlebell swings (15lb, 10lb)**

**16 single unders or 32 imaginary jump rope**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**10 rounds for time:**

**10 kettlebell goblet squats (35lb, 22lb)**

**15 American kettlebell swings (35lb, 22lb)**

**10 double unders or 40 single unders**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
