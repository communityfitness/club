Today’s WOD (“Workout of the Day”) consists of five rounds of 15/12 calories on the air bike, 10 dumbbell push jerks, and 10 push-ups with a two minute rest between each round. Please pick your exercise modifications carefully, as you should be able to complete each round fairly quickly with minimal rest.  Record the time it takes you to complete each round separately. Though later rounds will definitely take longer than early rounds, try to pace yourself so that the difference isn’t too dramatic.

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**5 rounds, each for time:**

**15/12 calorie air bike**

**10 dumbbell push jerks (50lb, 35lb)**

**10 push-ups**

**Rest 2 minutes**
<!--more-->

Beginners can scale both the rep scheme and the movements in today’s workout. Do what works for you! A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**5 rounds, each for time:**

**10/8 calorie air bike**

**10 dumbbell push jerks or push presses (5lb, 3lb)**

**10 wall push-ups**

**Rest 2 minutes**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**5 rounds, each for time:**

**12/10 calorie air bike**

**10 dumbbell push jerks (35lb, 20lb)**

**10 kneeling or box push-ups**

**Rest 2 minutes**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

You will have 5 different scores today. Your scores are the amounts of time it takes you to complete each round of today’s workout, not counting the rest time.
