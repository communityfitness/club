[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

We will end the week with a tabata-style workout consisting of rowing, lunges, bear crawl, toes-to-bar, and air bike. For 8 rounds of 20 seconds of work and 10 seconds of rest you will complete an exercise at maximum effort then move on to the next exercise. Work hard, and finish this week strong!

2. Select “8 rounds of 0:20 work, 0:10 rest”.

You can also use “tabata songs” on YouTube to time your workout.
