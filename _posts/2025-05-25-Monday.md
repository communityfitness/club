Happy Memorial Day, Community Fitness Club! It has become a tradition in many American fitness communities to perform a workout known as “Murph” on Memorial Day. “Murph” is done in honor of Lieutenant Michael P. Murphy, a U.S. Navy SEAL who died in Afghanistan on June 28, 2005.

This workout is very challenging. It starts with a one mile run, followed by 100 pull-ups, 200 push-ups, and 300 air squats, and ends with a second mile run. “Murph” is performed to honor those who have sacrificed their lives in service to our country. Don’t be afraid to push your limits!

The pull-ups, push-ups, and air squats in today’s WOD can be partitioned as desired. For example, you could do 5 rounds of 20 pull-ups, 40 push-ups, and 60 air squats; 10 rounds of 10 pull-ups, 20 push-ups, and 30 air squats; or 20 rounds of 5 pull-ups, 10 push-ups, and 15 air squats. Do whatever works for you.

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

***Murph***

**For time:**

**1 mile run (1600 meters)**

**100 pull-ups**

**200 push-ups**

**300 air squats**

**1 mile run**

***All with weight vest (20lb/14lb)***
<!--more-->

Don’t be intimidated if you can’t do a full “Murph”. You can scale the workout to your current fitness level and still honor our country’s heroes. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**For time:**

**400m run, 400m row, or 100 jumping jacks**

**25 ring rows**

**50 wall push-ups**

**75 air squats or sit-to-stands**

**400m run, 400m row, or 100 jumping jacks**

***Suggested partitioning: 5 rounds of 5 ring rows, 10 wall push-ups, and 15 air squats***

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of “Murph” is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**For time:**

**800m run, 800m row, or 250 jumping jacks**

**50 jumping pull-ups**

**100 box or kneeling push-ups**

**150 air squats**

**800m run, 800m row, or 250 jumping jacks**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
