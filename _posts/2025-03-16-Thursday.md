Today’s workout contains only one movement, and it’s everyone’s favorite: the burpee! Okay, so the burpee isn’t likely to win any popularity contests, but it is a great full body exercise. The trick today is to scale appropriately and break the burpees into manageable sets. You can do it! I believe in you!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**For time:**

**200 burpees**
<!--more-->

Beginners should reduce the total number of burpees in today’s WOD. Beginners can also modify their burpees. Check out the burpees link at the bottom of this page for more information on how to modify burpees, and then pick the variation that is right for you! A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**125 elevated, no push-up burpees**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**150 step-back burpees**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
