[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

I don’t put running in workouts very often because not everyone has a good place to do it. However, I couldn’t resist programming a nice run for today, since I’m at the beach. If running isn’t for you, please row instead. Along with running, today’s WOD has push-ups, sit-ups, and air squats. I hope you enjoy it!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**For time:**

**10 push-ups**

**20 sit-ups**

**30 air squats**

**Run or row 800 meters**

**10 push-ups**

**20 sit-ups**

**30 air squats**

**Run or row 800 meters**

**10 push-ups**

**20 sit-ups**

**30 air squats**

**Run or row 800 meters**

**10 push-ups**

**20 sit-ups**

**30 air squats**
<!--more-->

Beginners can shorten the distances, reduce the number of repetitions, and modify the movements. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**For time:**

**5 wall push-ups**

**10 anchored or assisted sit-ups**

**15 air squats or sit-to-stands**

**Run or row 400 meters**

**5 wall push-ups**

**10 anchored or assisted sit-ups**

**15 air squats or sit-to-stands**

**Run or row 400 meters**

**5 wall push-ups**

**10 anchored or assisted sit-ups**

**15 air squats or sit-to-stands**

**Run or row 400 meters**

**5 wall push-ups**

**10 anchored or assisted sit-ups**

**15 air squats or sit-to-stands**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**For time:**

**10 kneeling or box push-ups**

**20 sit-ups**

**30 air squats**

**Run or row 600 meters**

**10 kneeling or box push-ups**

**20 sit-ups**

**30 air squats**
