Usually I tell you exactly how I want you to do each day’s WOD, but today is different. Today I want you to complete 150 wall balls and 50 pull-ups, but you can break up the repetitions however you desire. You can do 5 rounds of 30 wall balls and 10 pull-ups, 10 rounds of 15 wall balls and 5 pull-ups, or something entirely different. Just try to get through the workout as quickly as you can!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**For time:**

**150 wall balls (20lb, 14lb)**

**50 pull-ups**

***Broken up as desired***
<!--more-->

Beginners can substitute dumbbell thrusters, air squats, or sit-to-stands for wall balls and ring rows for pull-ups in today’s workout. Even with these modifications, the rep scheme in the experienced version of the workout may be too much, so you can also reduce the total number of repetitions of each movement if that makes the workout more doable for you. Some workout is always better than no workout! A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**For time:**

**100 wall balls, dumbbell thrusters (5lb, 3lb), air squats, or sit-to-stands**

**40 ring rows**

***Broken up as desired***

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**For time:**

**150 wall balls (14lb, 10lb)**

**50 jumping or banded pull-ups or 25 regular pull-ups**

***Broken up as desired***

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
