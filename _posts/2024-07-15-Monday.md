Happy Monday, Community Fitness Club! Today’s WOD (“Workout of the Day”) contains wall walks, Russian kettlebell swings, and rowing. Wall walks will build your strength, balance, and coordination, while rowing and kettlebell swings are great full-body exercises that will increase your muscular endurance. Try to keep a steady pace throughout today’s workout. Attempt to row the second round at a similar speed as your first round, and complete the kettlebell swings in as few sets as possible. 

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**3 rounds for time:**

**4 wall walks**

**40 Russian kettlebell swings (71lb, 53lb)**

**400 meter row**

 

Beginners can substitute inchworms for wall walks and use a lighter kettlebell for today’s workout. Also, if the full workout is overwhelming, feel free to shorten it to make it seem more doable. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**3 rounds for time:**

**6 inchworms**

**30 Russian kettlebell swings (20lb, 15lb)**

**300 meter row**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**3 rounds for time:**

**4 partial wall walks or 8 inchworm push-ups**

**40 Russian kettlebell swings (53lb, 35lb)**

**400 meter row**
