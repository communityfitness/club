TGIF, Community Fitness Club! We will finish the week with a workout that combines thrusters, pull-ups, wall balls, and ring rows. First you will complete 21 thrusters and 21 pull-ups, then 15 thrusters and 15 pull-ups, then 9 thrusters and 9 pull-ups. You will then rest for 3 minutes. After this break, you will complete 21 wall balls and 21 ring rows, then 15 wall balls and 15 ring rows, then 9 wall balls and 9 ring rows. It’s a lot, but you can do it!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**For time:**

**21 - 15 - 9:**

**Thrusters (75lb, 55lb)**

**Pull-ups**

***Rest 3 minutes, then:***

**21 - 15 - 9:**

**Ring rows**

For the first part of the WOD, beginners can perform dumbbell thrusters, air squats, or sit-to-stands instead of barbell thrusters and ring rows instead of pull-ups. For the second part of the WOD, beginners can either perform lighter wall balls or substitute wall ball goblet squats, air squats, or sit-to-stands. Reverse snow angels can replace ring rows in the second half of the workout. The overall rep scheme can also be altered to make today’s workout more appropriate for beginning athletes. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**For time:**

**15 - 10 - 5:**

**Dumbbell thrusters (5lb, 3lb), air squats, or sit-to-stands**

**Ring rows**

***Rest 3 minutes, then:***

**15 - 10 - 5:**

**Wall balls (10lb, 10lb), wall ball goblet squats (10lb, 10lb), air squats, or sit-to-stands**

**Reverse snow angels**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**For time:**

**21 - 15 - 9:**

**Thrusters (45lb, 35lb)**

**Jumping or banded pull-ups**

***Rest 3 minutes, then:***

**21 - 15 - 9:**

**Wall balls (14lb, 10lb)**

**Ring rows**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout. Include the 3 minute rest period in your total time.
