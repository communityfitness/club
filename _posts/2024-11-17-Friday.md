It’s finally Friday, Community Fitness Club! Let’s finish the week off strong with a 12 minute AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”). The goal of today’s workout is to complete as many rounds of 15 kettlebell swings, 10 up and down planks, and 5 deadlifts as you can during the 12 minute workout period. 

Please be careful when performing your deadlifts today. This workout will really fatigue your core, so pick a deadlift weight that you can lift safely, and be mindful throughout the workout. If you need to reduce the weight, that is okay! You know your body best!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**12 minute AMRAP:**

**15 American kettlebell swings (53lb, 35lb)**

**10 up and down planks**

**5 deadlifts (225lb, 155lb)**
<!--more-->

Beginners can scale the movements and the rep scheme in today’s WOD. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**12 minute AMRAP:**

**12 Russian kettlebell swings (20lb, 15lb)**

**30 second plank hold**

**5 kettlebell deadlifts (20lb, 15lb)**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**12 minute AMRAP:**

**15 American kettlebell swings (35lb, 22lb)**

**10 up and down planks**

**5 deadlifts (125lb, 95lb)**

Your score is the total number of rounds and reps you complete during the AMRAP.
