[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Tomorrow we will celebrate our loved ones. Today let’s celebrate ourselves! The workout today is a slow-paced, recovery WOD. Move through the movements in today’s workout in an unhurried, unforced manner. We will not be scoring today’s WOD, so feel free to spend more time on the movements that feel good and less time on the movements that don’t. 

Everyone will be performing the same WOD today:

***Love Yourself***

**For 15 minutes:**

**10-20 seconds of forward bend stretch**
