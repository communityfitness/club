Happy Labor Day, Community Fitness Club! Let’s celebrate by getting sweaty! In today’s WOD (“Workout of the Day”) we will complete 5 rounds of 14 calories on the rower and 14 burpee box jump overs. The goal is to move through the workout as quickly as you can, but please be careful on the box jumps. Switch to box step-overs if you need to. There’s no need to ruin your holiday with a bloody shin!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**5 rounds for time:**

**14 calorie row**

**14 burpees box jump overs (24in., 20in.)**
<!--more-->

Beginners can scale today’s workout by altering the rep scheme and by modifying the burpee box jump overs. Choose the burpees modification that works for you! A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**5 rounds for time:**

**10 calorie row**

**10 elevated, no push-up burpees**

**10 box jumps or box step-ups to a comfortable height**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**5 rounds for time:**

**12 calorie row**

**12 step-back burpee box jump overs to a comfortable height**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
