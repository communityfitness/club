TGIF! Let’s end the week with a two-part workout. In the first part of today’s WOD, you will complete 50 double unders and 50 lunges, followed by 40 double unders and 40 lunges, followed by 30 double unders and 30 lunges. Then you will immediately move into the second part of the workout where you will complete 20 pull-ups and 20 calories on the air bike, followed by 15 pull-ups and 15 calories on the air bike, followed by 10 pull-ups and 10 calories on the air bike.

Push yourself to complete today’s workout as quickly as you can. It’s challenging, but you can do it!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**For time:**

**50-40-30:**

**Double unders**

**Alternating lunges**

***Directly into:***

**20-15-10:**

**Pull-ups**

**Air bike calories**
<!--more-->

Beginners can scale today’s workout by modifying the lunges and by substituting single unders or imaginary jump rope for double unders and ring rows for pull-ups. The number of repetitions for each movement can be scaled as well. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**For time:**

**30-20-10:**

**Single unders (or 60-40-20 imaginary jump rope)**

**Modified lunges**

***Directly into:***

**15-10-5:**

**Ring rows**

**Air bike calories**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**For time:**

**50-40-30:**

**Single unders (or 25-20-15 double unders)**

**Alternating lunges**

***Directly into:***

**20-15-10:**

**Jumping or banded pull-ups**

**Air bike calories**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
