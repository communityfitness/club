Today’s WOD (“Workout of the Day”) is “Christine,” another benchmark workout consisting of 3 rounds of a 500 meter row, 12 deadlifts, and 21 box jumps. Though the goal is to finish as quickly as possible, please be careful on both the deadlifts and the box jumps. When performing the deadlifts, pick an appropriate weight for you, engage your core, and keep your back straight. With the box jumps, pay attention to each jump, and choose a height that is right for you. You can also switch to box step-ups if needed.

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

***Christine***

**Experienced:**

**3 rounds for time:**

**500m row**

**12 deadlifts (bodyweight)**

**21 box jumps (24in., 20in.)**
<!--more-->

If this type of workout is new to you, please modify both the movements and the weights. Perform kettlebell deadlifts instead of barbell deadlifts, and move through each set of deadlifts mindfully to maintain proper form. Pick a height that you feel comfortable with for the box jumps. Remember, you can also substitute box step-ups if you don’t feel up for box jumps today. Also feel free to shorten the row to a manageable distance for you. A beginner’s version of *Christine* could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**3 rounds for time:**

**300m row**

**12 kettlebell deadlifts (35lb, 22lb)**

**21 box jumps or 22 box step-ups to a comfortable height**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of *Christine* is right for you today. Choose the weight for your deadlift carefully, and pick a box height that you are comfortable with. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**3 rounds for time:**

**500m row**

**12 deadlifts (95lb, 75lb)**

**21 box jumps to a comfortable height**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
