Today’s WOD (“Workout of the Day”) consists of 10 rounds of a 20 second Superman hold, 30 mountain climbers, and 12 dumbbell walking lunges. Experienced athletes should attempt to keep their Superman holds unbroken. Everyone else, feel free to break up the hold as necessary! Pick a weight for your dumbbell walking lunges that allows you to complete the entire set each round without putting down your dumbbells. Push hard to complete this one as quickly as possible!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**10 rounds for time:**

**20 second Superman hold**

**30 mountain climbers (each leg counts as one rep)**

**12 dumbbell walking lunges (50lb, 35lb)**
<!--more-->

Beginners can shorten the length of the Superman hold and reduce the number of repetitions for both the mountain climbers and lunges to make today’s workout more doable. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**10 rounds for time:**

**15 second Superman hold (broken up as needed)**

**20 mountain climbers (each leg counts as one rep)**

**8 modified lunges**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**10 rounds for time:**

**20 second Superman hold (broken up as needed)**

**30 mountain climbers (each leg counts as one rep)**

**12 dumbbell walking lunges (30lb, 20lb)**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
