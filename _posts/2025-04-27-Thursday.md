We made it to May, Community Fitness Club! Let’s kick off the new month with a chipper style WOD. In a chipper, you complete all the repetitions of one movement before continuing on to the next movement. In this way, you slowly “chip” away at the workout. As always, modify, modify, modify! There are a lot of movements in today’s WOD, so there are many opportunities to personalize the workout to your personal fitness level. Pick the scaling options that are right for you today!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD: 

**Experienced:**

**For time:**

**10 calorie row**

**40 deadlifts (95lb, 65lb)**

**10 calorie row**

**30 hang power cleans (95lb, 65lb)**

**10 calorie row**

**20 handstand push-ups**

**10 calorie row**

**10 toes-to-bar**

**10 calorie row**
<!--more-->

Beginners, please scale both the movements and the number of repetitions to your current fitness level. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**For time:**

**6 calorie row**

**30 dumbbell deadlifts (8lb, 5lb)**

**6 calorie row**

**20 dumbbell hang power cleans (8lb, 5lb)**

**6 calorie row**

**15 dumbbell push presses (8lb, 5lb)**

**6 calorie row**

**10 toes-to-rig**

**6 calorie row**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**For time:**

**8 calorie row**

**40 deadlifts (65lb, 45lb)**

**8 calorie row**

**30 hang power cleans (65lb, 45lb)**

**8 calorie row**

**20 box handstand push-ups**

**8 calorie row**

**10 hanging leg raises**

**8 calorie row**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s WOD.
