[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

To continue this week’s Valentine’s theme, today we will perform the workout “Happy Heart”. It contains:

**H**andstand push-ups

**E**levated burpee box jumps

**A**ir squats

**R**ing rows

**T**oes-to-bar

If you are a more experienced athlete, it is likely you have never performed elevated burpees before. They are a modification commonly used for beginning athletes, but it’s always good to try new things! To perform an elevated burpee, place your hands on the edge of a plyo box, jump your feet out into a plank position, do a push-up to the box, and jump your feet back. We will finish the elevated burpees today with a box jump. If ring rows seem too simple for you, consider placing your feet on the box to elevate your body during the ring row. You might find this exercise even more challenging than pull-ups!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

***Happy Heart***

**Experienced:**

**14 minute AMRAP:**

**5 handstand push-ups**

**5 elevated burpee box jumps (24in., 20in.)**

**5 air squats**

**5 ring rows with feet elevated**

**5 toes-to-bar**
<!--more-->

Beginners can modify the movements. Instead of handstand push-ups, perform 20 seconds of downward-facing dog stretch each round. Do the elevated burpees without the push-up or the box jump, and perform toes-to-rig rather than toes-to-bar. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**14 minute AMRAP:**

**20 second downward-facing dog stretch**

**5 elevated, no push-up burpees**

**5 air squats or sit-to-stands**

**5 ring rows**

**5 toes-to-rig**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**14 minute AMRAP:**

**5 box handstand push-ups or handstand kick-ups with controlled descent**

**5 elevated burpee box jumps to a comfortable height**

**5 air squats**

**5 ring rows**

**5 hanging knee raises**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total number of rounds and reps you complete during today’s workout.
