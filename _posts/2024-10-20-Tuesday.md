[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up) 

Today’s workout is an AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”) in which you will perform as many rounds of 20 double unders, 10 alternating lunges, 10 kettlebell swings, and 10 up and down planks as you can in 15 minutes. The sets are small, so try to keep them as unbroken as possible, and really push to get in as many rounds and repetitions as possible!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**20 double unders**

**10 alternating lunges**

**10 American kettlebell swings (53lb, 35lb)**

**10 up and down planks**
<!--more-->

Beginners can modify today’s workout in several ways. First, please feel free to perform regular single unders or imaginary jump rope instead of double unders. Secondly, the lunges can be modified by holding onto the wall or the rig to help with balance, or by taking smaller steps and not lowering your back knee as close to the ground. Also, Russian kettlebell swings can replace the American kettlebell swings, and plank hold can be substituted for the up and down planks. Finally, the rep scheme can be altered to better align with your current fitness abilities. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**10 single unders or 30 imaginary jump rope**

**8 modified lunges**

**8 Russian kettlebell swings (20lb, 15lb)**

**20 second plank hold**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**10 double unders or 40 single unders**

**10 alternating lunges**

**10 American kettlebell swings (35lb, 22lb)**

**10 up and down planks**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total number of rounds and repetitions you complete in the 15 minute AMRAP.
