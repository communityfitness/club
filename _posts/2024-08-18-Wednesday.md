Today’s WOD (“Workout of the Day”) consists of 10 rounds of a 200 meter row, 15 kettlebell swings, and 10 kettlebell box step-ups. Your goal is to complete the workout as quickly as possible while maintaining good form throughout. You can do it!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**10 rounds for time:**

**200 meter row**

**15 American kettlebell swings (53lb, 35lb)**

**10 kettlebell box step-ups (53lb, 35lb), (24in., 20in.)**
<!--more-->

A beginner can modify the number of rounds in today’s WOD to make it more doable. I also suggest that beginners pick a lighter kettlebell and perform Russian, rather than American, kettlebell swings. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**8 rounds for time:**

**200 meter row**

**15 Russian kettlebell swings (20lb, 15lb)**

**10 kettlebell box step-ups to a comfortable height (20lb, 15lb)**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**10 rounds for time:**

**200 meter row**

**15 American kettlebell swings (35lb, 22lb)**

**10 kettlebell box step-ups to a comfortable height (35lb, 22lb)**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
