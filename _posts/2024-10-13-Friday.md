[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

TGIF, Community Fitness Club! We will close out the week with a tabata-style workout. In a tabata, you perform given movements for eight rounds of 20 seconds of work and 10 seconds of rest. 

In the first tabata of today’s WOD, you will cycle through each scale variation twice. That is, you will perform a front scale on your left foot for 20 seconds, then a front scale on your right foot for 20 seconds, then a back scale on your left foot for 20 seconds, then a back scale on your right foot for 20 seconds. You will then repeat all four movements one more time. 

In the next four tabatas, you will cycle through Russian twists, mountain climbers, dumbbell push presses, and dumbbell goblet squats, resting a minute between each tabata.

To time today’s workout using the SmartWOD timer app: 
1. Select “TABATA”. 
2. Choose 8 rounds of 0:20 work, 0:10 rest.
3. Press the plus sign beside “Add sets (optional)”.
4. Choose 5 sets with 1:00 minutes of rest between sets. 
5. Press “START TIMER”.

Tabatas scale automatically. A beginner will naturally perform fewer reps than an advanced athlete. But sometimes other modifications need to be made as well, and that’s okay! Do what you can do today, and that will be good enough. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**Tabata 1 - Scales (front left, front right, back left, back right)**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 2 - Cycle through:**

**Russian twists with heels resting lightly on the floor**

**Mountain climbers**

**Dumbbell push presses (8lb, 5lb)**

**Dumbbell goblet squats or sit-to-stands (8lb, 5lb)**

***Rest 1 minute***
