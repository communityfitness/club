[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up) 

Thank goodness it’s Friday! We will close out this week with a 20 minute EMOM (“Every Minute On the Minute”) in which we will perform 45 seconds of jumping jacks in the first minute, 45 seconds of Superman hold in the second minute, 45 seconds of push-ups in the third minute, 45 seconds of a wall sit in the fourth minute, and 45 seconds of toes-to-bar in the fifth minute. This will continue for 3 more rounds until the 20 minutes are up. Please pick an amount of time to perform each movement that is appropriate for how you feel today.

To time today’s workout using the SmartWOD timer app:

1. Select “EMOM”.
2. Choose “Every 1 for 20”.
3. Press “START TIMER”.

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**20 minute EMOM:**

**Minute 1: 45 seconds of jumping jacks**

**Minute 2: 45 seconds of Superman hold**

**Minute 3: 45 seconds of push-ups**

**Minute 4: 45 seconds of wall sit**

**Minute 5: 45 seconds of toes-to-bar**

Beginners can modify both the movements and the amount of time they are performed. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**20 minute EMOM:**

**Minute 1: 40 seconds of jumping jacks**

**Minute 2: 30 seconds of Superman hold**

**Minute 3: 40 seconds of wall push-ups**

**Minute 4: 30 seconds of wall sit**

**Minute 5: 40 seconds of toes-to-rig or toes-to-wall**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**20 minute EMOM:**

**Minute 1: 45 seconds of jumping jacks**

**Minute 2: 40 seconds of Superman hold**

**Minute 3: 45 seconds of kneeling push-ups or box push-ups**
