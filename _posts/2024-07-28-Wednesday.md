[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Today’s workout consists of four 3-minute AMRAPs (“As Many Reps As Possible”). That means that in each 3-minute period you will perform as many rounds of 5 handstand push-ups, 5 wall ball squat cleans, and 5 box jumps as you can. Push as hard as you can during each AMRAP, as you will get 2 minutes to recover between each round.

To time today’s WOD using the SmartWOD timer:

(1) Press “TABATA”.

(2) Choose 4 rounds of 3 minutes of work and 2 minutes of rest.

(3) Press “START TIMER”.

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**Four 3 minute AMRAPs in 18 minutes:**

**5 handstand push-ups**

**5 wall ball squat cleans (20lb, 14lb)**

**5 box jumps (24in., 20in.)**

***Rest 2 minutes***

AMRAPs scale automatically. A beginner will naturally perform fewer reps than an advanced athlete. However, it is often necessary to scale other aspects of the workout as well. Beginners can perform dumbbell push presses instead of handstand push-ups, wall ball goblet squats or sit-to-stands rather than wall ball squat cleans, and can adjust the height of the box jumps. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**Four 3 minute AMRAPs in 18 minutes:**

**5 dumbbell push presses (10lb, 8lb)**

**5 wall ball goblet squats (10lb, 10lb) or sit-to-stands**

**5 box jumps or 6 box step-ups to a comfortable height**

***Rest 2 minutes***

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**Four 3 minute AMRAPs in 18 minutes:**

**5 box handstand push-ups or 5 handstand kick-ups with a controlled descent**

**5 wall ball squat cleans (14lb, 10lb)**

**5 box jumps to a comfortable height**

***Rest 2 minutes***
