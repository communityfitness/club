[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Today’s workout will give you a chance to practice some of the trickier movements we perform regularly here at Community Fitness Club: handstand push-ups, toes-to-bar, and double unders. 

In today’s WOD, you will practice handstand push-ups for 45 seconds in the 1st minute, toes-to-bar for 45 seconds in the 2nd minute, and double unders for 45 seconds in the 3rd minute. You will then repeat this sequence 4 more times to complete the 15 minute workout. 

If these movements are difficult for you, don’t worry about how many repetitions you are able to perform each minute. Just practice the best you can! Check out various modification and scaling options in the links at the bottom of this post. If you are skilled at these movements, then try to accumulate as many repetitions as possible, but be careful to pace yourself so that you don’t burn out in those later rounds!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**On an 15 minute running clock:**

**0:00-1:00: 45 seconds of handstand push-ups**

**1:00-2:00: 45 seconds of toes-to-bar**

**2:00-3:00: 45 seconds of double unders**

**3:00-4:00: 45 seconds of handstand push-ups**

**4:00-5:00: 45 seconds of toes-to-bar**

**5:00-6:00: 45 seconds of double unders**

**6:00-7:00: 45 seconds of handstand push-ups**

**7:00-8:00: 45 seconds of toes-to-bar**

**8:00-9:00: 45 seconds of double unders**

**9:00-10:00: 45 seconds of handstand push-ups**

**10:00-11:00: 45 seconds of toes-to-bar**

**11:00-12:00: 45 seconds of double unders**

**12:00-13:00: 45 seconds of handstand push-ups**

**13:00-14:00: 45 seconds of toes-to-bar**

**14:00-15:00: 45 seconds of double unders**

Beginners can scale today’s WOD by performing a downward-facing dog stretch instead of handstand push-ups, substituting single unders or single under practice for the double unders, and by performing toes-to-rig instead of toes-to-bar. You can also shorten the amount of time you perform each movement. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**On an 15 minute running clock:**

**0:00-1:00: 35 seconds of downward-facing dog stretch**

**1:00-2:00: 35 seconds of toes-to-rig**

**2:00-3:00: 35 seconds of single unders**

**3:00-4:00: 35 seconds of downward-facing dog stretch**

**4:00-5:00: 35 seconds of toes-to-rig**

**5:00-6:00: 35 seconds of single unders**

**6:00-7:00: 35 seconds of downward-facing dog stretch**

**7:00-8:00: 35 seconds of toes-to-rig**

**8:00-9:00: 35 seconds of single unders**

**9:00-10:00: 35 seconds of downward-facing dog stretch**

**10:00-11:00: 35 seconds of toes-to-rig**

**11:00-12:00: 35 seconds of single unders**

**12:00-13:00: 35 seconds of downward-facing dog stretch**

**13:00-14:00: 35 seconds of toes-to-rig**

**14:00-15:00: 35 seconds of single unders**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**On an 15 minute running clock:**

**0:00-1:00: 40 seconds of handstand kick-ups with a slow descent**

**1:00-2:00: 40 seconds of hanging leg raises**

**2:00-3:00: 40 seconds of double under practice**

**3:00-4:00: 40 seconds of handstand kick-ups with a slow descent**

**4:00-5:00: 40 seconds of hanging leg raises**

**5:00-6:00: 40 seconds of double under practice**

**6:00-7:00: 40 seconds of handstand kick-ups with a slow descent**

**7:00-8:00: 40 seconds of hanging leg raises**

**8:00-9:00: 40 seconds of double under practice**

**9:00-10:00: 40 seconds of handstand kick-ups with a slow descent**

**10:00-11:00: 40 seconds of hanging leg raises**

**11:00-12:00: 40 seconds of double under practice**

**12:00-13:00: 40 seconds of handstand kick-ups with a slow descent**

**13:00-14:00: 40 seconds of hanging leg raises**

**14:00-15:00: 40 seconds of double under practice**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.
