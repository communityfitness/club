[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up) 

It’s hump day, Community Fitness Club! In today’s workout you will complete as many rounds of 9/6 calories on the air bike (9 calories for men, 6 calories for women), 6 burpees, and 3 power cleans as you can in 14 minutes. Please note that the power cleans are a bit heavier than usual today. Pick a weight that is challenging but that you can still move with good form. If your form deteriorates as the workout progresses, please drop down to a lighter weight. No workout is worth getting injured over!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**14 minute AMRAP:**

**9/6 calorie air bike**

**6 burpees**

**3 power cleans (125lb, 95lb)**
<!--more-->

Beginners can modify the movements and the number of repetitions in today’s workout. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**14 minute AMRAP:**

**6/4 calorie air bike**

**6 elevated, no push-up burpees**

**3 dumbbell power cleans (12lb, 8lb)**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**14 minute AMRAP:**

**9/6 calorie air bike**

**6 step-back burpees**

**3 power cleans (95lb, 65lb)**

Your score is the total number of rounds and repetitions you complete during today’s workout.
