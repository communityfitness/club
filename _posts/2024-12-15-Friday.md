[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Many people will be celebrating the holy night of Christmas next week, but this Friday we’re going to celebrate a “Swoly Night” instead! “Swole” is a slang term that means “extremely muscular” or “to have a nice physique,” and this workout will help you achieve that goal. Just remember to scale as needed. You’ll still get in a good workout if you reduce the total number of repetitions, modify the movements, or lighten the weights. Do what you need to do, then go have a great weekend!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

***Swoly Night***

**Experienced:**

**For time:**

**50 American kettlebell swings (53lb, 35lb)**

**40 dumbbell overhead walking lunge (35lb, 25lb)**

**30 kettlebell goblet squats (53lb, 35lb)**

**20 hang power cleans (95lb, 65lb)**

**10 bar facing burpees**

**20 hang power cleans (95lb, 65lb)**

**30 kettlebell goblet squats (53lb, 35lb)**

**40 dumbbell overhead walking lunge (35lb, 25lb)**

**50 American kettlebell swings (53lb, 35lb)**
<!--more-->

Beginners can modify both the movements and the rep scheme in today’s workout. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**For time:**

**25 Russian kettlebell swings (20lb, 15lb)**

**20 modified lunges**

**15 kettlebell goblet squats (20lb, 15lb) or sit-to-stands**

**10 dumbbell hang power cleans (8lb, 5lb)**

**5 elevated, no push-up burpees**

**10 dumbbell hang power cleans (8lb, 5lb)**

**15 kettlebell goblet squats (20lb, 15lb) or sit-to-stands**

**20 modified lunges**

**25 Russian kettlebell swings (20lb, 15lb)**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**50 American kettlebell swings (35lb, 22lb)**

**40 dumbbell walking lunge (30lb, 20lb)**

**30 kettlebell goblet squats (35lb, 22lb)**
