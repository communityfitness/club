It’s hump day, Community Fitness Club! Let’s get over the hump with a WOD (“Workout of the Day”) consisting of 10 rounds of 2 wall walks, a 200 meter row, and 15 kettlebell swings. Be smart in picking your scaling option for the wall walks today. It’s okay if you need to rest between repetitions especially in the later sets, but every rep should be able to be performed safely. If you start to get too wobbly, switch to an easier modification! Pick a weight for your kettlebell swings that allows you to complete most of the rounds unbroken. You can do it!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**10 rounds for time:**

**2 wall walks**

**200 meter row**

**15 American kettlebell swings (53lb, 35lb)**
<!--more-->

Beginning athletes can modify both the movements and the number of rounds in today’s workout. Russian kettlebell swings can be substituted for American kettlebell swings, and inchworms can be done instead of wall walks. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**8 rounds for time:**

**4 inchworms**

**200 meter row**

**15 Russian kettlebell swings (20lb, 15lb)**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**10 rounds for time:**

**2 partial wall walks or box wall walks or 4 inchworm push-ups**

**200 meter row**

**15 American kettlebell swings (35lb, 22lb)**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
