It’s the last day of April, Community Fitness Club! Let’s see out the month with a WOD (“Workout of the Day”) that contains a lot of very short rounds. For today’s workout we will perform 15 rounds of 1 wall walk and 5 burpees. The wall walks will be the trickiest part, so pick a scaling option that works for you. And if that option gets too hard, scale some more! Work hard, but stay safe out there!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**For time:**

**15 rounds for time:**

**1 wall walk**

**5 burpees**
<!--more-->

Beginners can substitute inchworms for the wall walks and modify the burpees to make today’s workout more doable. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**For time:**

**12 rounds for time:**

**2 inchworms**

**5 elevated, no push-up burpees**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**For time:**

**15 rounds for time:**

**1 partial wall walk or 3 inchworm push-ups**

**5 step-back burpees**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
