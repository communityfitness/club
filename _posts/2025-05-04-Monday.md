[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

It’s Monday, Community Fitness Club! Our first workout of the week consists of 10 rounds of 4 burpees, 8 wall balls, and 12 Russian kettlebell swings. Each round is quite short, so you might be tempted to start out too hard and fast. Instead, try to pace yourself from the beginning, so that you can keep moving consistently all the way through the workout. You can do it!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**10 rounds for time:**

**4 burpees**

**8 wall balls (20lb, 14lb)**

**12 Russian kettlebell swings (53lb, 35lb)**
<!--more-->

Beginners can modify the burpees and the wall balls and reduce the weight of the kettlebell swings in today’s workout. The rep scheme can also be scaled. You know your body best! Do what’s right for you! A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**10 rounds for time:**

**3 elevated, no push-up burpees**

**6 wall balls, wall ball goblet squats, or sit-to-stands**

**9 Russian kettlebell swings (20lb, 15lb)**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**10 rounds for time:**

**4 step-back burpees**

**8 wall balls (14lb, 10lb)**

**12 Russian kettlebell swings (35lb, 22lb)**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total number of rounds and repetitions you complete during today’s workout.
