Happy 4th of July, Community Fitness Club! Let’s celebrate America’s Independence Day with a “1776” themed workout consisting of 4 rounds of 17 kettlebell swings, 7 burpees, and 6 handstand push-ups. This is a short one, so push hard, get it done, and then enjoy the rest of your holiday!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

***1776***

**Experienced:**

**4 rounds for time:**

**17 American kettlebell swings (53lb, 35lb)**

**7 burpees**

**6 handstand push-ups**
<!--more-->

Even on the 4th of July, beginners should perform Russian rather than American kettlebell swings. They are safer, and I want you feeling great for whatever celebration you’re taking part in today! Beginners can also modify the burpees and perform seated dumbbell presses rather than handstand push-ups. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**4 rounds for time:**

**17 Russian kettlebell swings (20lb, 15lb)**

**7 elevated, no push-up burpees**

**6 seated dumbbell presses (8lb, 5lb)**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**4 rounds for time:**

**17 American kettlebell swings (35lb, 22lb)**

**7 step-back burpees**

**6 box handstand push-ups**

Your score is the amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
