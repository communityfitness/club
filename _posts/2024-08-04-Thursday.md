[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Today’s WOD (“Workout of the Day”) is a 20 minute EMOM. EMOM stands for “Every Minute On the Minute.” That means that in today’s workout, you will complete 40 mountain climbers in the first minute, a 30 second Superman hold in the second minute, 10 up and down planks in the third minute, and 20 alternating lunges in the fourth minute. You will then repeat this cycle four more times until the 20 minutes are up. If you finish a movement before the given minute is complete, rest and wait until the next minute to begin the next movement.

To time today’s WOD using the SmartWOD timer app:
1. Press “EMOM”.
2. Select “Every 1 for 20”.
3. Press “START TIMER”.

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**20 minute EMOM:**

**Minute 1: 40 mountain climbers (each leg counts as one rep)**

**Minute 2: 40 second Superman hold**

**Minute 3: 10 up and down planks**

**MInute 4: 20 alternating lunges (each leg counts as one rep)**
<!--more-->

Beginners can shorten the length of the Superman hold, reduce the number of repetitions for both the mountain climbers and lunges, and substitute plank hold for up and down planks to make today’s workout more doable. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**20 minute EMOM:**

**Minute 1: 20 mountain climbers (each leg counts as one rep)**

**Minute 2: 20 second Superman hold (broken up as needed)**

**Minute 3: 30 second high plank hold (broken up as needed)**

**Minute 4: 10 modified lunges (each leg counts as one rep)**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**20 minute EMOM:**

**Minute 1: 30 mountain climbers (each leg counts as one rep)**

**Minute 2: 30 second Superman hold (broken up as needed)**

**Minute 3: 8 up and down planks**

**Minute 3: 16 alternating lunges (each leg counts as one rep)**

Your score is the total number of repetitions you complete during the 20 minute EMOM. Count each second of the Superman hold as one repetition.
