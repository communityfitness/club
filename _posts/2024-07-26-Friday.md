**Friday - 7/26/24**

[Warm-up](https://www.communityfitness.club/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Our last workout of the week contains only two movements: wall balls and box jumps. Pick a weight for your wall balls that allows you to complete large sets. Ideally, you should be able to complete each round of wall balls in today’s workout in no more than two sets. And, as always, be careful on the box jumps! Switch to a shorter box or box step-ups if you need to. Don’t be afraid to scale today. You’ll still get in a great workout! 

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**For time:**

**40 wall balls (20lb, 14lb)**

**30 box jumps (24in., 20in.)**

**30 wall balls**

**20 box jumps**

**20 wall balls**

**10 box jumps**

**10 wall balls**

Beginners can scale the rep scheme and modify the movements in today’s workout to make it more doable. Dumbbell thrusters, air squats, or sit-to-stands can be substituted for the wall balls, and box step-ups can be substituted for the box jumps if needed. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**For time:**

**20 wall balls (10lb, 10lb), dumbbell thrusters (5lb, 3lb), air squats, or sit-to-stands**

**15 box jumps or 16 box step-ups to a comfortable height**

**15 wall balls, dumbbell thrusters, air squats, or sit-to-stands**

**10 box jumps or box step-ups to a comfortable height**

**10 wall balls, dumbbell thrusters, air squats, or sit-to-stands**

**5 box jumps or 6 box step-ups to a comfortable height**

**5 wall balls, dumbbell thrusters, air squats, or sit-to-stands**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**For time:**

**35 wall balls (14lb, 10lb)**

**25 box jumps to a comfortable height**

**25 wall balls**

**15 box jumps to a comfortable height**

**15 wall balls**

**5 box jumps to a comfortable height**

**5 walls balls**
