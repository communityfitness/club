Today’s WOD (“Workout of the Day”) has three parts. You will begin by completing a 30 calorie row. You will then perform 4 rounds of 10 power cleans and 40 mountain climbers. Finally, the workout will end with a second 30 calorie row. Today’s workout is challenging, especially if you move quickly with few breaks. Just do your best and that will be good enough!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**For time:**

**Buy in: 30 calorie row**

**Then 4 rounds:**

**10 power cleans (115lb, 75lb)**

**40 mountain climbers**

**Buy out: 30 calorie row**

Beginners can scale the movements and the number of repetitions to make today’s workout more doable. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**For time:**

**Buy in: 20 calorie row**

**Then 4 rounds:**

**10 dumbbell hang power cleans (8lb, 5lb)**

**20 mountain climbers**

**Buy out: 20 calorie row**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**For time:**

**Buy in: 25 calorie row**

**Then 4 rounds:**

**10 power cleans (75lb, 55lb)**

**30 mountain climbers**

**Buy out: 25 calorie row**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
