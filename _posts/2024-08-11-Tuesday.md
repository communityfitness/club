Today’s WOD (“Workout of the Day”) will test your stamina. Your whole body will feel the combined effects of 40 handstand push-ups, 60 box jumps, 80 kettlebell swings, and one kilometer of rowing. Try to keep your breaks short and move through the workout as quickly as possible. Be smart, though! Pick scaling options that allow you to keep moving and are appropriate for your current fitness level.

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**2 rounds for time:**

**20 handstand push-ups**

**30 box jumps (24in., 20in.)**

**40 American kettlebell swings (53lb, 35lb)**

**500 meter row**
<!--more-->

Beginners can modify today’s workout by substituting push presses for handstand push-ups and Russian kettlebell swings for American kettlebell swings. The rep scheme can also be scaled as needed. Change what you need to change so that the workout feels doable for you. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**3 rounds for time:**

**12 dumbbell push presses (8lb, 5lb)**

**20 box jumps to a comfortable height**

**25 Russian kettlebell swings (20lb, 15lb)**

**300 meter row**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**2 rounds for time:**

**20 box handstand push-ups or dumbbell push presses (35lb, 20lb)**

**30 box jumps to a comfortable height**

**40 American kettlebell swings (35lb, 22lb)**

**500 meter row**

Your score is the amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
