[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Today’s workout is a 16 minute EMOM (“Every Minute On the Minute”) in which you will perform 20 goblet squats in the first minute, 20 sit-ups in the second minute, 20 kettlebell swings in the third minute, and 10/8 calories on the air bike in the fourth minute. This will continue for 4 rounds until the 16 minutes are complete. If you finish a movement before the given minute is complete, rest and wait until the next minute to begin the next movement. 

It’s a good idea to test all of these movements during your warm-up, and pick a number of repetitions that you can complete in 30 to 40 seconds. You will slow down as the workout progresses, so be smart when choosing your rep scheme. Try to pick a number of repetitions per minute that you can maintain for the whole 16 minutes.

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**16 minute EMOM:**

**MInute 1: 20 kettlebell goblet squats (53lb, 35lb)**

**Minute 2: 20 abmat sit-ups**

**Minute 3: 20 American kettlebell swings (53lb, 35lb)**

**Minute 4: 10/8 calorie air bike**
<!--more-->

Today’s WOD can be scaled by modifying the movements, reducing the weight of your kettlebell, and scaling the number of repetitions in each minute. A scaled version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**16 minute EMOM:**

**MInute 1: 10 kettlebell goblet squats (20lb, 15lb), air squats, or sit-to-stands**

**Minute 2: 10 anchored or assisted sit-ups**

**Minute 3: 20 Russian kettlebell swings (20lb, 15lb)**

**Minute 4: 6/4 calorie air bike**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**16 minute EMOM:**

**MInute 1: 15 kettlebell goblet squats (35lb, 22lb)**

**Minute 2: 15 abmat sit-ups**

**Minute 3: 20 American kettlebell swings (35lb, 22lb)**

**Minute 4: 8/6 calorie air bike**
