Let’s end the week with a simple workout containing only two movements: rowing and air squats. Don’t mistake simple for easy though! Today’s WOD consists of 5 challenging rounds of 500 meters on the rower followed by 40 air squats. This volume of air squats will be difficult, so scale as needed. Work hard, and then go enjoy your weekend!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**5 rounds for time:**

**500 meter row**

**40 air squats**
<!--more-->

Beginners may find that a larger number of shorter rounds are preferable to a smaller number of longer rounds. It’s okay to make that change! A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**8 rounds for time:**

**300 meter row**

**20 air squats or sit-to-stands**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**6 rounds for time:**

**400 meter row**

**30 air squats**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
