Happy Halloween, Community Fitness Club! Let’s celebrate with a chipper style Halloween WOD. In a chipper, you complete all the reps of the first movement before continuing on to the next movement. In this way, you slowly “chip” away at the repetitions. Modify, modify, modify! There are a lot of movements in today’s WOD, so there are many opportunities to personalize the workout to your fitness level. You know your body best! Pick the scaling options and weights that are right for you!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

***Hallowod***

**Experienced:**

**For time:**

**10 toes-to-bar**

**31 pull-ups**

**10 abmat sit-ups**

**31 box jumps (24in., 20in.)**

**31 American kettlebell swings (53lb, 35lb)**

**10 abmat sit-ups**

**31 dumbbell push jerks (50lb, 35lb)**

<!--more-->

Beginners can modify the movements in today’s workout to make it more doable. Also, feel free to omit or shorten the row at the end if the rest of the WOD is already overwhelming or if you are short for time. Here is a possible beginner’s version of *Hallowod*:

And here is another version. Mix and match to find what is right for you!
