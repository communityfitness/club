Today’s WOD is guaranteed to get your heart rate up. Try to pick a thruster weight that you can perform in unbroken sets for the first half of the workout and broken into no more than two sets the second half of the workout. This WOD is meant to be fast-paced. Remember, the quicker you work the quicker, it will be over! 

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

***Torch that Turkey***

**Experienced:**

**10 rounds for time:**

**10 thrusters (75lb, 55lb)**

**100m row**
<!--more-->

Ten rounds may be too many for a beginner to do at a high intensity. Reduce the number of rounds and pick a manageable thruster weight. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**7 rounds for time:**

**10 dumbbell thrusters (5lb, 3lb) or air squats or sit-to-stands**

**100m row**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**10 rounds for time:**

**10 thrusters (45lb, 35lb) or dumbbell thrusters (20lb, 15lb)**

**100m row**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete the workout.
