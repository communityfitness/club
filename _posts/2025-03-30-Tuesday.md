Happy April Fools Day! Let’s celebrate with a workout called “Joker”. In today’s WOD, you will complete 1 toes-to-bar and 10 deadlifts, then 2 toes-to-bar and 9 deadlifts, then 3 toes-to-bar, and 8 deadlifts, and so on until you end with 10 toes-to-bar and 1 deadlift. Be sure to pick an appropriate weight for your deadlifts today. Despite the name, today’s WOD is no joke! You will complete 55 deadlifts in total, so be careful of your form throughout. Keep your back straight and your core engaged. If something doesn’t feel right, don’t be a fool: change to a lighter weight! 

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:
