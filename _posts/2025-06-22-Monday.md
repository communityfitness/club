[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

I’m on vacation this week, Community Fitness Club! To celebrate, every workout this week can be done outside with no equipment. (Of course, they can all be done at the gym too!) So put on your favorite vacation music, and let’s get sweaty!

The WOD today consists of 4 rounds of 100 feet of bear crawl, 100 feet of walking lunges, and 100 flutter kicks. Don’t worry about measuring out your distance exactly. Just approximate the best you can. (Thirty big steps should be around 100 feet.)

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**4 rounds for time:**

**100 feet of bear crawl**

**100 feet of walking lunges**

**100 flutter kicks**
<!--more-->

Feel free to shorten the distances to make this workout a little easier. It is also okay to substitute modified alternating lunges for the walking lunges if that is more appropriate for you today. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**4 rounds for time:**

**50 feet of bear crawl**

**16 modified lunges**

**50 flutter kicks**

Both the distances and the number of rounds can be adjusted to make this WOD appropriate for your fitness level. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**3 rounds for time:**

**100 feet of bear crawl**

**100 feet of walking lunges**

**100 flutter kicks**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
