[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

In today’s workout “The Chocolate Chipper” you’ll “chip away” at reps of double unders, wall sit, Superman hold, kettlebell swings, dead hang, lunges, rowing, sit-ups, push-ups, and pull-ups. You’ll only see each of these movements once in today’s workout, so push to finish each exercise as quickly as possible as you work your way through the WOD!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

***The Chocolate Chipper***

**Experienced:**

**100 double unders**

**90 second wall sit**

**80 second Superman hold**

**70 Russian kettlebell swings (53lb, 35lb)**

**60 second dead hang**

**50 alternating lunges**

**400 meter row**

**30 abmat sit-ups**

**20 push-ups**

**10 pull-ups**
<!--more-->

I would like beginners to keep the chipper structure of today’s workout but modify the movements and scale to a number of repetitions that seems doable. All the hold times (wall sit, Superman hold, and dead hang) are cumulative and can be performed in several sets. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**For time:**

**100 imaginary jump rope or 50 single unders**

**60 second wall sit**

**50 second Superman hold**

**40 Russian kettlebell swings (20lb, 15lb)**

**30 modified lunges**

**300 meter row**

**20 second dead hang (with tiptoes on floor if needed)**

**20 anchored sit ups**

**20 wall push-ups**

**10 ring rows**

Many people will feel comfortable getting through all the repetitions if they simply scale the movements and the weights. Another version of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**For time:**

**200 single unders or 50 double unders**

**90 second wall sit**

**80 second Superman hold**

**70 Russian kettlebell swings (35lb, 22lb)**

**60 second dead hang**

**50 alternating lunges**

**400 meter row**

**30 abmat sit ups**

**20 kneeling push-ups**

**10 jumping or banded pull-ups**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s WOD.
