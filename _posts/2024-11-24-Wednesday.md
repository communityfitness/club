Tomorrow you will likely be feasting with family, so let’s burn off some calories beforehand with a tough workout with multiple helpings of burpees. This one will be hard, but you can do it!

The numbers in parentheses beside the movements are the suggested weights to use. The weight for males is listed first, and the weight for females is listed second. Use a weight that is right for you. The weights listed are suggestions only.

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

***Death  Before Thanksgiving***

**Experienced:**

**For time:**

**30 abmat sit-ups**

**20 burpees**

**30 American kettlebell swings (53lb, 35lb)**

**20 burpees**

<!--more-->

The burpees will be the toughest part of today’s workout, so pick a modification that works for you and reduce the number of reps. You can also reduce the number of repetitions of the other movements in the WOD. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**For time:**

**20 anchored or assisted sit-ups**

**10 elevated, jumping no push-up burpees**

**20 Russian kettlebell swings (20lb, 15lb)**

**10 elevated, jumping no push-up burpees**

**20 high jumps**

**10 elevated, jumping no push-up burpees**

**20 Russian kettlebell swings**

**10 elevated, jumping no push-up burpees**

**20 anchored or assisted sit-ups**

You can also do something between the experienced version and the beginner version of today’s WOD. Another variation might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**For time:**

**25 abmat sit-ups**

**15 step-back burpees**

**25 American kettlebell swings (35lb, 22lb)**

**15 step-back burpees**

**25 tuck jumps**

**15 step-back burpees**

**25 tuck jumps**

**15 step-back burpees**

**25 American kettlebell swings**

**15 step-back burpees**

**25 abmat sit-ups**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
