[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Today’s workout is a 12 minute AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”) in which you’ll perform as many rounds as you can of 2 wall walks and 20 Russian kettlebell swings. The wall walks will challenge your balance and coordination, while the kettlebell swings will increase your muscular power. Though the goal of the workout is to complete as many rounds and repetitions as possible, please use caution when performing the wall walks. Only move as close to the wall as you feel comfortable with, and modify the wall walks as needed as you get more fatigued.

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**12 minute AMRAP:**

**2 wall walks**

**20 Russian kettlebell swings (53lb, 35lb)**
<!--more-->

A beginner will naturally perform fewer rounds and repetitions than an advanced athlete. However, it may be necessary to scale the movements as well. You can substitute inchworms for wall walks and use a lighter weight for the Russian kettlebell swings. You can also modify the rep scheme. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**12 minute AMRAP:**

**2 inchworms**

**15 Russian kettlebell swings (15lb, 10lb)**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**12 minute AMRAP:**

**2 partial wall walks or 4 inchworm push-ups**

**20 Russian kettlebell swings (35lb, 22lb)**

Your score is the total number of rounds and repetitions you complete during today’s workout.
