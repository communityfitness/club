TGIF, Community Fitness Club! We’ll finish off the week with a workout consisting of three 5-minute AMRAPs (“As Many Reps As Possible”) separated by a 3 minute rest period between each set. During each 5 minute period you will complete as many repetitions of 12 dumbbell walking lunges, 4 broad jumps, and 30 double unders as you can. You will then rest for 3 minutes before continuing on to the next AMRAP. Start your AMRAP wherever you left off in the previous round. There’s a significant rest period between each AMRAP, so really try to push your pace during the workout periods!

To time today’s workout using the SmartWOD timer app: 

1. Press “TABATA”.
2. Select “3 rounds of 5:00 work and 3:00 rest”.
3. Press “START TIMER”.

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**Three 5-minute AMRAPs in 21 minutes:**

**12 dumbbell walking lunges (50lb, 35lb)**

**4 broad jumps**

**30 double unders**

***Rest 3 minutes between rounds**
<!--more-->

Beginners can do single leg leaps or smaller hops instead of broad jumps. They can also perform single unders or imaginary jump rope rather than double unders and modify the lunges as needed. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**Three 5-minute AMRAPs in 21 minutes:**

**12 modified lunges**

**4 single leg leaps or two-legged hops**

**15 single unders or 30 imaginary jump rope**

***Rest 3 minutes between rounds**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**Three 5-minute AMRAPs in 21 minutes:**

**12 dumbbell walking lunges (35lb, 25lb)**

**4 broad jumps**

**15 double unders or 60 single unders**

***Rest 3 minutes between rounds**

Your score is the total number of rounds and reps you complete during the three 5-minute AMRAPs.
