[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

TGIF, Community Fitness Club! We will close out this week with an AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”) consisting of as many rounds of 5 squat jumps, 10 up and down planks, 5 dumbbell push presses, and 20 double unders as we can complete during the 12 minute time period. I like ending the week with an AMRAP, because it scales to however you’re feeling that day. If you’re tired after a long week of working out, move a little slower and take longer breaks. If you’re feeling strong, push hard and get in as many reps as possible! 

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**12 minute AMRAP:**

**5 squat jumps**

**10 up and down planks**

**5 dumbbell push presses (40lb, 30lb)**

**20 double unders**
<!--more-->

AMRAPs scale automatically. A beginner will naturally perform fewer reps than an advanced athlete. However, it is often necessary to scale other aspects of the workout as well. Beginners can perform air squats or sit-to-stands instead of squat jumps, plank holds instead of up and down planks, and single unders or imaginary jump rope instead of double unders. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**12 minute AMRAP:**

**5 air squats or sit-to-stands**

**20 second plank hold**

**5 dumbbell push presses (8lb, 5lb)**

**10 single unders or 20 imaginary jump rope**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**12 minute AMRAP:**

**5 squat jumps**

**10 up and down planks**

**5 dumbbell push presses (30lb, 20lb)**

**10 double unders or 40 single unders**

Your score is the total number of rounds and reps you complete during the 12 minute AMRAP.
