[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Let’s mark hump day with a 16 minute AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”). Today you will complete as many rounds of 8 thrusters, 8 calorie air bike, 8 power cleans, and 8 toes-to-bar as you can in the 16 minute workout period. Pick scaling options that allow you to keep moving, and push to complete as many rounds and repetitions as you can!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**16 minute AMRAP:**

**8 thrusters  (95lb, 65lb)**

**10/8 calorie air bike**

**8 power cleans (95lb, 65lb)**

**8 toes-to-bar**
<!--more-->

Beginners can scale the movements and rep scheme in today’s WOD to make it more doable. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**16 minute AMRAP:**

**6 dumbbell thrusters (8lb, 5lb) or air squats or sit-to-stands**

**6/4 calorie air bike**

**6 dumbbell power cleans (8lb, 5lb)**

**6 toes-to-rig**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**16 minute AMRAP:**

**8 thrusters  (45lb, 35lb)**

**8/6 calorie air bike**

**8 power cleans (45lb, 35lb)**

**8 hanging leg raises**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult. Your score is the total number of rounds and repetitions you complete during today’s workout.
