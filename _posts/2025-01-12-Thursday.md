[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

I think today’s workout will be a fun one! It is a 12 minute AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”) consisting of rounds of 5 light deadlifts, 4 hang power cleans, 3 handstand push-ups, 2 box jump overs, and 1 wall walk. The goal of today’s workout is to complete as many rounds and repetitions as you can in the 12 minute time period. 

Notice that we’re performing box jump overs instead of regular box jumps today. That means that you will jump onto the box and then jump or step off the other side of the box. Unlike box jumps, you do not have to stand up all the way on top of the box when performing box jump overs. Check out the link at the bottom of the post for some tips on how to perform box jump overs more efficiently.

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**12 minute AMRAP:**

**5 deadlifts (105lb, 75lb)**

**4 hang power cleans (105lb, 75lb)**

**3 handstand push-ups**

**2 box jump overs (24in., 20in.)**

**1 wall walk**
<!--more-->

Beginners can substitute dumbbell deadlifts and dumbbell hang power cleans for their barbell counterparts. Instead of handstand push-ups, consider performing a downward dog stretch, so that you can still reap the benefits of getting upside down. If you don’t feel like jumping today, you can perform box step overs instead of box jump overs. Inchworms can also be substituted for the wall walks. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**12 minute AMRAP:**

**5 dumbbell deadlifts (10lb, 8lb)**

**4 dumbbell hang power cleans (10lb, 8lb)**

**15 second downward-facing dog stretch**

**2 box jump overs or box step overs to a comfortable height**

**2 inchworms**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**12 minute AMRAP:**

**5 deadlifts (75lb, 55lb)**

**4 hang power cleans (75lb, 55lb)**

**3 box handstand push-ups or handstand kick-ups with a slow, controlled descent**

**2 box jump overs to a comfortable height**

**1 partial wall walk or 3 inchworm push-ups**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total number of rounds and reps you complete during the 12 minute AMRAP.
