[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

In today’s workout, we will complete 5 rounds of a 300 meter row, 30 double unders, and 3 wall walks. Both double unders and wall walks take time and practice to master, so don’t worry if you can’t perform them in a workout yet. That’s okay! Either pick a variation that allows you to practice in order to improve your skill, or just do one of the many other scaled options instead. You’ll still get in a great workout either way! 

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**5 rounds for time:**

**300 meter row**

**30 double unders**

**3 wall walks**
<!--more-->

Beginners can substitute inchworms for the wall walks and single unders or imaginary jump rope for the double unders. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**5 rounds for time:**

**300 meter row**

**30 single unders or 60 imaginary jump rope**

**6 inchworms**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the workout is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**5 rounds for time:**

**300 meter row**

**15 double unders or 60 single unders**

**3 partial wall walks or box wall walks or 9 inchworm push-ups**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
