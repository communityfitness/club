[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Today we will commemorate September 11 with a tough tribute WOD (“Workout of the Day”). Please notice that most of the movements in today’s workout are a little more challenging than I typically program. The box jumps are higher, the weights are heavier, and the pull-ups are the more difficult chest-to-bar variety. Really try to push yourself today. Eleven repetitions is a small enough number to attempt a tougher variation than usual. However, it is also important to be smart! Pick scaling options that are challenging but that you can perform safely. No workout is worth being injured for, and that includes today’s WOD!

Beginners can modify today’s workout in a number of ways. First, the 2001 meter run or row at the beginning of the workout can be taken out. Next, the barbell movements can be replaced with dumbbell variations. Try to go a little heavier with the dumbbells today, though. It’s okay if you need to break up a movement into a couple of sets to get through it. Instead of burpee pull-ups, beginners can perform their chosen burpee modification and then perform a ring row. Try to pick a more challenging burpee today. If you normally perform elevated, no push-up burpees, consider doing elevated burpees with a push-up or step-back, no push-up burpees to the floor today. You know your body best. Push yourself, but stay safe! A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**For time:**

**11 box jumps or box step-ups to a challenging but safe height**

**11 dumbbell thrusters (12lb, 8lb) or air squats or sit-to-stands**

**11 elevated burpees into ring rows**

**11 dumbbell power cleans (15lb, 10lb)**

**11 wall push-ups**

**11 Russian kettlebell swings (20lb, 15lb)**

**11 toes-to-rig**

**11 kettlebell deadlifts (35lb, 22lb)**

**11 dumbbell push jerks (15lb, 10lb) or dumbbell push presses (12lb, 8lb)**

**2001 meter run or row**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**For time:**

**2001 meter run or row**

**11 box jumps (24in., 20in.)**

**11 thrusters (95lb, 65lb)**

**11 burpee pull-ups or burpees into jumping pull-ups**

**11 power cleans (125lb, 85lb)**

**11 box handstand push-ups or regular push-ups**

**11 American kettlebell swings (53lb, 35lb)**

**11 knees-to-elbows**

**11 deadlifts (125lb, 85lb)**

**11 push jerks (95lb, 65lb)**

**2001 meter run or row**
