It’s Monday again, Community Fitness Club! Let’s mark the beginning of the week with a fun workout that will get your heart pumping. In today’s WOD, you will complete one round of 5 pull-ups, 15 wall balls, and 30 double unders every 3 minutes for 6 rounds. Please do a test round of this workout while you are warming up, so that you can pick scaling options that allow you to complete the full sequence each round with some rest time remaining. Also, don’t worry if you can’t perform some of these movements. There are always ways to modify the workouts so that everyone can take part!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**Every 3 minutes for 6 rounds:**

**5 pull-ups**

**15 wall balls (20lb, 14lb)**

**30 double unders**
<!--more-->

Beginners can modify both the movements and the rep scheme in today’s workout. Ring rows can be substituted for pull-ups, and single unders or imaginary jump rope can be substituted for double unders. If wall balls are still tough for you, feel free to perform dumbbell thrusters, air squats, or sit-to-stands instead. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**Every 3 minutes for 6 rounds:**

**5 ring rows**

**10 wall balls (10lb, 10lb) or dumbbell thrusters (5lb, 3lb) or sit-to-stands**

**15 single unders or 30 imaginary jump rope**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**Every 3 minutes for 6 rounds:**

**5 jumping or banded pull-ups**

**15 wall balls (14lb, 10lb)**

**15 double unders or 60 single unders**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.
