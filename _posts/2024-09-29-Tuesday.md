Can you believe it’s already October! Let’s kick off the new month with 5 rounds of 12 dumbbell walking lunges, 21 kettlebell swings, and a 300 meter row. Scale each movement in a way that makes sense for you today, and take breaks as needed. Just do your best, and that will be good enough!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**5 rounds for time:**

**12 dumbbell walking lunges (50lb, 35lb)**

**21 American kettlebell swings (53lb, 35lb)**

**300 meter row**
<!--more-->

Today’s workout can be modified by scaling both the rep scheme and the movements. While performing the lunges, you don’t have to bring your knee all the way to the ground, and you can use a wall, the rig, or a chair for balance and support. You can also substitute Russian kettlebell swings for the American kettlebell swings. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**5 rounds for time:**

**8 modified lunges**

**15 Russian kettlebell swings (20lb, 15lb)**

**300 meter row**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**5 rounds for time:**

**12 dumbbell walking lunges (30lb, 20lb)**

**21 American kettlebell swings (35lb, 22lb)**

**300 meter row**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
