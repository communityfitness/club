[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

In today’s workout, you will perform a buy-in of 100 single unders and then a descending ladder of wall balls and burpees (10 wall balls and 10 burpees, followed by 9 wall balls and 9 burpees, followed by 8 wall balls and 8 burpees, etc.). You will then complete the workout with a buy-out of another 100 single unders. Because you will be jumping a lot in the buy-in and buy-out of today’s WOD, we will omit the jump at the end of each burpee. Simply stand to full extension at the end of each burpee, then drop back down to the ground to repeat the burpee movement. I bet you’re getting really good at them by now!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**For time:**

**Buy in: 100 single unders**

**10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1:**

**Wall balls (20lb, 14lb)**

**Burpees (Stand to extension, no jump)**

**Buy out: 100 single unders**

Many beginners struggle with jumping rope, wall balls, and burpees. That’s okay! You can substitute imaginary jump rope for the single unders and dumbbell thrusters or sit-to-stands for the wall balls. You can also modify the burpees and scale the rep scheme. Even with these changes, you will still get in a great workout! A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**For time:**

**Buy in: 100 imaginary jump rope or 50 single unders**

**9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1:**

**Wall balls, dumbbell thrusters (5lb, 3lb), or sit-to-stands**

**Elevated, no push-up burpees**

**Buy out: 100 imaginary jump rope or 50 single unders**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**For time:**

**Buy in: 80 single unders**

**10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1:**

**Wall balls (14lb, 10lb)**

**Step-back burpees (Stand to extension, no jump)**

**Buy out: 80 single unders**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
