[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Today’s workout is an AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”) in which we will perform as many rounds of 12 Russian kettlebell swings, 8 box jumps, and 4 burpees as we can in 14 minutes. Heavy kettlebell swings will increase your muscular power; box jumps will increase your explosiveness; and burpees are just a great full-body exercise. Combined, these movements will help you become a better overall athlete! 

Notice that the kettlebell swings in today’s workout are Russian, that is swung to eye level, and heavier than usual. Also, make sure you stand all the way up at the top of each box jump, and open up your hips fully at the top of each burpee!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**14 minute AMRAP:**

**12 Russian kettlebell swings (71lb, 53lb)**

**8 box jumps (24in., 20in.)**

**4 burpees**
<!--more-->

Beginners should pick a kettlebell weight that they can perform safely. Don’t worry about performing heavy swings; pick a weight that you can swing with good form. Also, if your joints don’t feel up for jumping, consider substituting box step-ups instead. You can hold on to your kettlebell during these step-ups for added difficulty or perform them with your body weight only. Burpees can also be scaled in multiple ways. Check out the link at the bottom of this post for some of the burpee variations you can choose from. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**14 minute AMRAP:**

**12 Russian kettlebell swings (20lb, 15lb)**

**8 box jumps or box step-ups to a comfortable height**

**4 elevated, no-push-up burpees**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**14 minute AMRAP:**

**12 Russian kettlebell swings (53lb, 35lb)**

**8 box jumps to a comfortable height**

**4 step-back burpees**

Your score is the total number of rounds and reps you complete during today’s workout.
