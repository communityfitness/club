Today’s WOD is a 14 minute AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”) that consists of mountain climbers, sit-ups, dumbbell box step-ups, and dumbbell push presses. The goal of today’s workout is to complete as much work as possible in the time limit, so work hard, move fast, and do your best!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**14 minute AMRAP:**

**20 mountain climbers**

**15 abmat sit-ups**

**10 dumbbell box step-ups (50lb, 35lb), (24in., 20in.)**

**5 dumbbell push presses (50lb, 35lb)**
<!--more-->

Beginners can scale the weight of the dumbbell and the height of the box in today’s workout. The rep scheme can also be modified as needed. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**14 minute AMRAP:**

**12 mountain climbers**

**10 assisted or anchored sit-ups**

**10 dumbbell box step-ups to a comfortable height (8lb, 5lb)**

**5 dumbbell push presses (8lb, 5lb)**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**14 minute AMRAP:**

**20 mountain climbers**

**15 abmat sit-ups**

**10 dumbbell box step-ups to a comfortable height (35lb, 20lb)**

**5 dumbbell push presses (35lb, 20lb)**

Your score is the total number of rounds and reps you complete during today’s workout.
