[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

It’s Tabata Tuesday, Community Fitness Club! We will begin with a tabata of air biking for calories, then we will rest for one minute. For the second tabata, we will alternate between performing 20 seconds of farmers carry and 20 seconds of dumbbell goblet squats, and then we will again rest for a minute. For the third tabata, we will alternate between 20 seconds of leg raises and 20 seconds of Superman holds. After another one minute rest, we will continue on to the fourth tabata in which we will alternate between 20 seconds of waiters carry and 20 seconds of dumbbell walking lunges. After our last one minute rest period, we will finish with a tabata of alternating bear crawl and mountain climbers.

You can also use “tabata songs” on YouTube to time your workout. Check out the link at the bottom of the post for more information.

Tabatas scale automatically. A beginner will naturally perform fewer reps and hold movements for less time than an advanced athlete. However, it may also be necessary to scale other aspects of the workout. Modify the movements and the weight of the dumbbells as needed. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**Tabata 1: Air bike for calories**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 2: Alternate between farmers carry and dumbbell goblet squats (25lb, 15lb)**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 3: Alternate between leg raises and Superman holds**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 4: Alternate between two arm waiters carry (5lb, 3lb) and modified lunges**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 5: Alternate between bear crawl and mountain climbers**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**Tabata 1: Air bike for calories**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 2: Alternate between farmers carry and dumbbell goblet squats (50lb, 35lb)**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 3: Alternate between leg raises and Superman holds**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 4: Alternate between two arm waiters carry and dumbbell walking lunges (35lb, 20lb)**

***Rest 1 minute***

**Tabata 5: Alternate between bear crawl and mountain climbers**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.
