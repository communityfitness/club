[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Let’s celebrate Christmas Eve with a Christmas-themed tabata workout. Today some of our familiar exercises will get a Christmas makeover! In our first tabata, we will alternate between toy soldier march (high knees) and snowy mountain climbers (mountain climbers) to get warmed up. Then after a short break, we’ll put a kettlebell to use with ice fishing (kettlebell deadlifts) and sleighbell swings (kettlebell swings). Next we’ll channel our inner polar bear with backward and forward polar bear crawl (bear crawl). For our fourth tabata, our upper bodies will be put to work with Santa’s gift lifts (dumbbell push presses) and Christmas pie push-ups (push-ups). Finally, we’ll challenge our core with jelly belly blasters (sit-ups) and tinsel twists (Russian twists).

To time today’s workout using the SmartWOD timer app: 

1. Select “TABATA”. 
2. Choose 8 rounds of 0:20 work, 0:10 rest.
3. Press the plus sign beside “Add sets (optional)”.
4. Choose 5 sets with 1:30 minutes of rest between sets. 
5. Press “START TIMER”.

You can also use “tabata songs” on YouTube to time your workout. For fun, consider using these Christmas carol tabata songs for today’s workout: [Jingle Bells](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73nKgG3wBuE), [We Wish You A Merry Christmas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beKuEh71IMU), [Last Christmas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4qHgceVmDM), [Santa Claus Is Coming to Town/Jingle Bell Rock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCUYDv6yzH4&list=PLGCVvKvm0mDnySTNDLGvPiGnB8BmF2MCB&index=6&t=0s), [Underneath the Tree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQYjlYE1Spk&list=PLGCVvKvm0mDnySTNDLGvPiGnB8BmF2MCB&index=3&t=0s).

Tabatas scale automatically. A beginner will naturally perform fewer reps than an advanced athlete. However, it may also be necessary to scale the movements. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**Tabata 1 - Alternate between Toy Soldier March (high knees) and Snowy Mountain Climbers (mountain climbers)**

***Rest 90 seconds***

**Tabata 2 - Alternate between Ice Fishing (kettlebell deadlifts) and Sleighbell Swings (Russian kettlebell swings) (20lb, 15lb)**

***Rest 90 seconds***

**Tabata 3 - Alternate between forward and backward Polar Bear Crawl (bear crawl)**

***Rest 90 seconds***

**Tabata 4 - Alternate between Santa’s Gift Lift (dumbbell push presses) (5lb, 3lb) and Christmas Pie Push-ups (wall push-ups)**

***Rest 90 seconds***

**Tabata 5 - Alternate between Jelly Belly Blasters (anchored or assisted sit-ups) and Tinsel Twists (Russian twists) (no dumbbell)**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**Tabata 1 - Alternate between Toy Soldier March (high knees) and Snowy Mountain Climbers (mountain climbers)**

***Rest 90 seconds***

**Tabata 2 - Alternate between Ice Fishing (kettlebell deadlifts) and Sleighbell Swings (American kettlebell swings) (35lb, 22lb)**

***Rest 90 seconds***

**Tabata 3 - Alternate between forward and backward Polar Bear Crawl (bear crawl**

***Rest 90 seconds***

**Tabata 4 - Alternate between Santa’s Gift Lift (dumbbell push presses) (35lb, 20lb) and Christmas Pie Push-ups (kneeling or box push-ups)**

***Rest 90 seconds***

**Tabata 5 - Alternate between Jelly Belly Blasters (abmat sit-ups) and Tinsel Twists with a dumbbell (25lb, 15lb) (Russian twists)**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.
