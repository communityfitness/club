[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

Yesterday’s WOD was very taxing, so today we will focus on recovery. Today’s workout is a slow-paced WOD that we’ve done several times before. Move through the movements in an unhurried, unforced manner. Also, please note that the 10-30 denotes the number of seconds to hold each exercise, *not* the number of repetitions to perform. We will not be scoring today’s WOD, so feel free to spend more time on the movements that feel good and less time on the movements that don’t. 

Everyone will be performing the same WOD today:

**For 12 minutes:**

**10-30 seconds of forward bend stretch**

**10-30 seconds of plank**

**10-30 seconds of cobra stretch**

**10-30 seconds of reverse snow angels**

**10-30 seconds of downward-facing dog stretch**

**10-30 seconds of cat cow stretches**

**10-30 seconds of child’s pose**

You might also try some foam roller exercises today. Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz4xHEgMaLY) that goes over some basic ones you can experiment with.
