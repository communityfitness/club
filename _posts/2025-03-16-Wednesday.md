Today’s workout is a 16 minute EMOM (“Every Minute on the Minute”). In this workout, you will ride the air bike for 12/10 calories in the first minute (12 calories for men, 10 calories for women), do 8 power cleans in the second minute, perform a hollow body hold for 30 seconds in the third minute, and then you will rest for the fourth minute. This will continue for 4 rounds until the 16 minutes are up. If you finish a movement before the given minute is complete, rest and wait until the next minute to begin the next movement. 

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**16 minute EMOM:**

**Minute 1: 12/10 calories air bike**

**Minute 2: 8 power cleans (105lb, 75lb)**

**Minute 3: 30 second hollow body hold (unbroken)**

**Minute 4: rest**
<!--more-->

Today’s WOD can be scaled by reducing the number of repetitions in each minute and by modifying the movements. Scale the number of reps to a number that you can complete in 45 seconds or less. This way you have at least 15 seconds to rest before transitioning to the next movement. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**16 minute EMOM:**

**Minute 1: 8/6 calories air bike**

**Minute 2: 8 dumbbell power cleans (12lb, 8lb)**

**Minute 3: 20 second hollow body hold (broken as needed)**

**Minute 4: rest**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**16 minute EMOM:**

**Minute 1: 10/8 calories air bike**

**Minute 2: 8 power cleans (75lb, 55lb)**

**Minute 3: 30 second hollow body hold (broken as needed)**

**Minute 4: rest**

Your score is the total number of repetitions you complete during today’s workout.
