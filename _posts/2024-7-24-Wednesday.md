**Wednesday - 7/24/24**

[Warm-up](https://www.communityfitness.club/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

For today’s WOD (“Workout of the Day”), we will perform 8 rounds of 5 pull-ups, 40 double unders, and 1 wall walk. The rounds are meant to go by quickly, so pick scaling options that you are good at and feel confident performing. It’s okay to reduce the number of double unders per round, substitute single unders, or modify the wall walks. Make today’s workout quick and fun!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**
**For time: **
**8 rounds for time:**
**5 pull-ups**
**40 double unders**
**1 wall walk**
<!--more-->

Beginners can modify the rep scheme and scale the movements. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

 

**Scaled 1:**

**For time: **

**8 rounds for time:**

**4 ring rows**

**20 single unders or 40 imaginary jump rope**

**2 inchworms**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**8 rounds for time:**

**5 jumping pull-ups or banded pull-ups **

**20 double unders or 60 single unders**

**1 partial wall walk or 2 inchworm push-ups**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.
