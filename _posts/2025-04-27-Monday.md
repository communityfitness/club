It’s Monday, Community Fitness Club! Let’s get the new week off to a great start with a fun bodyweight AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”). In today’s workout, we will perform as many rounds of 5 pull-ups, 5 push-ups, 10 sit-ups, 10 air squats, 20 lunges, and 20 mountain climbers as we can in the 20 minute workout period. Try to find scaling options that allow you to keep moving throughout the WOD. You know your body best! Do what you need to do to get the most out of today’s workout!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**20 minute AMRAP:**

**5 pull-ups**

**5 push-ups**

**10 abmat sit-ups**

**10 air squats**

**20 alternating lunges**

**20 mountain climbers**
<!--more-->

A beginner can scale both the movements and the number of repetitions in each round. You can also shorten the workout if you need to. Do what works for you today! A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**16 minute AMRAP:**

**4 ring rows**

**4 wall push-ups**

**8 anchored or assisted sit-ups**

**8 air squats or sit-to-stands**

**12 modified lunges**

**12 mountain climbers**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**20 minute AMRAP:**

**5 jumping or banded pull-ups**

**5 kneeling or box push-ups**

**10 abmat sit-ups**

**10 air squats**

**20 alternating lunges**

**20 mountain climbers**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total number of rounds and repetitions you complete during today’s workout.
