Happy Monday, Community Fitness Club! We will begin the week with an AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”) where the goal is to complete as many rounds of 5 pull-ups, 5 push-ups, 5 wall balls, and 5 calories on the air bike as you can during the 15 minute workout period. Please modify as needed so that you can work steadily through the workout with only short breaks. Also, have fun out there today!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**5 pull-ups**

**5 push-ups**

**5 wall balls (20lb, 14lb)**

**5 calorie air bike**
<!--more-->

Beginners can scale today’s workout to make it more doable. Ring rows can be substituted for pull-ups; wall push-ups can be substituted for regular push-ups; and the rep scheme can be adjusted. The wall balls can also be scaled in a number of ways. Pick the option that works best for you!  A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**4 ring rows**

**4 wall push-ups**

**4 wall balls, dumbbell thrusters (5lb, 3lb), air squats, or sit-to-stands**

**4 calorie air bike**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**5 jumping or banded pull-ups**

**5 box or kneeling push-ups**

**5 wall balls (14lb, 10lb)**

**5 calorie air bike**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total number of rounds and reps you complete during the 15 minute AMRAP.
