TGIF, Community Fitness Club! Last week we performed the benchmark workouts “Cindy” and “Christine”. Today we will end the week with yet another benchmark WOD known as “Jackie” which consists of a 1000 meter row, followed by 50 empty barbell thrusters and 30 pull-ups. Pick scaling options that allow you to complete the thrusters and pull-ups in large sets! 

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

***Jackie***

**Experienced:**

**For time:**

**1000m row**

**50 thrusters (45lb, 35lb)**

**30 pull-ups**
<!--more-->

If barbells aren’t your thing or you are newer to working out, please substitute dumbbell thrusters, air squats, or sit-to-stands for the barbell thrusters. Feel free to shorten the row, and instead of pull-ups, try ring rows or one of the many other scaled options for pull-ups. A beginner’s version of “Jackie” could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**For time:**

**800m row**

**35 dumbbell thrusters (5lb, 3lb), air squats, or sit-to-stands**

**20 ring rows**

Of course, you can choose to scale in many different ways. Another way to scale today’s WOD is shown below. Choose the modifications that work best for you!

**Scaled 2:**

**For time:**

**1000m row**

**50 dumbbell thrusters (15lb, 10lb)**

**30 jumping or banded pull-ups**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
