[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up) 

Today’s workout is a 12 minute AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”). That means that we will be performing as many rounds of 4 deadlifts, 6 pull-ups, and 8 burpees as we can in the 12 minute time limit. Pick a challenging weight for your deadlifts today. It’s okay if you need to perform them as 4 quick singles toward the end of the workout. As aways though, be smart, and if your form feels off, go down in weight. No workout is worth injuring yourself for! 

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**12 minute AMRAP:**

**4 deadlifts (255lb, 175lb)**

**6 pull-ups**

**8 burpees**
<!--more-->

AMRAPs scale automatically. A beginner will naturally perform fewer rounds and reps than an advanced athlete. However, you may need to scale in other ways as well. Beginners can substitute kettlebell deadlifts for barbell deadlifts and ring rows for pull-ups. The burpees can also be modified as needed. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**12 minute AMRAP:**

**4 kettlebell deadlifts (35lb, 22lb)**

**6 ring rows**

**8 elevated, no push-up burpees**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**12 minute AMRAP:**

**4 deadlifts (175lb, 120lb)**

**6 jumping pull-ups or 3 regular pull-ups**

**8 step-back burpees**

Your score is the total number of rounds and reps you complete during the 12 minute workout.
