[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up) 

In today’s WOD (“Workout of the Day”) you will perform 4 rounds of 1-minute max effort rowing for calories, push-ups, and wall ball squat cleans. You will have 15 seconds to transition between each exercise and 2 minutes to rest between each set. Push hard, and try to stay as consistent as possible throughout the 4 rounds. You can do it!

To time today’s workout using the SmartWOD timer app: 

1. Select “TABATA”. 
2. Choose 3 rounds of 1:00 work, 0:15 rest.
3. Press the plus sign beside “Add sets (optional)”.
4. Choose 4 sets with 2 minutes of rest between sets. 
5. Press “START TIMER”.

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**4 rounds for total repetitions:**

**1 minute max effort: calorie row**

****15 second transition***

**1 minute max effort: push-ups**

****15 second transition***

**1 minute max effort: wall ball squat cleans (20lb, 14lb)**

****2 minute rest between rounds***

Beginners can modify the movements in today’s workout. Wall push-ups can be substituted for the regular push-ups, and wall ball goblet squats can replace the wall ball squat cleans. A beginner version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**4 rounds for total repetitions:**

**1 minute max effort: calorie row**

****15 second transition***

**1 minute max effort: wall push-ups**

****15 second transition***

**1 minute max effort: wall ball goblet squats**

****2 minute rest between rounds***

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**4 rounds for total repetitions:**

**1 minute max effort: calorie row**

****15 second transition***

**1 minute max effort: kneeling or box push-ups**

****15 second transition***

**1 minute max effort: wall ball squat cleans (14lb, 10lb)**

****2 minute rest between rounds***

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total number of repetitions you complete during today’s workout.
