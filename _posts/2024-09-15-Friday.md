It’s Friday, Community Fitness Club! We will end the week with 4 rounds of 400 meters on the rower, 20 squat jumps, 10 deadlifts, and 5 handstand push-ups. Most of the movements in today’s WOD are safe to perform quickly, but please take your time working through the deadlifts, and pick an appropriate weight for you. Be smart, work hard, and then go enjoy your weekend! You’ve earned it! 

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**4 rounds for time:**

**400 meter row**

**20 squat jumps**

**10 deadlifts (225lb, 155lb)**

**5 handstand push-ups**
<!--more-->

Beginners can substitute seated dumbbell presses for the handstand push-ups, kettlebell deadlifts for the barbell deadlifts, and air squats or sit-to-stands for the squat jumps. The rep scheme can also be adjusted. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**4 rounds for time:**

**300 meter row**

**15 squat jumps, air squats, or sit-to-stands**

**10 kettlebell deadlifts (20lb, 15lb)**

**5 seated dumbbell presses (8lb, 5lb)**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**4 rounds for time:**

**400 meter row**

**20 squat jumps**

**10 deadlifts (125lb, 95lb)**

**5 handstand kick-ups with a controlled descent or box handstand push-ups**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
