[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

In today’s workout, you will perform 50 double unders, a ladder of wall balls and sit-ups, and then another 50 double unders. For the wall ball and sit-up portion of the workout, you will perform 1 wall ball and 1 sit-up, then 2 wall balls and 2 sit-ups, then 3 wall balls and 3 sit-ups, increasing by 1 repetition each round until you perform 10 wall balls and 10 sit-ups. At that point, you will begin decreasing by 1 repetition each round until you finally finish with 1 wall ball and 1 sit-up. By the end of today’s workout, you will have performed 100 double unders, 100 wall balls, and 100 sit-ups! Pick modifications and a rep scheme that allow you to move quickly through the workout. This one is meant to be fast-paced!

Beginners can scale today’s WOD by substituting single unders or imaginary jump rope for the double unders and by modifying the wall balls and sit-ups. The rep scheme can also be altered to make the workout more doable. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**For time:**

**Buy in: 40 single unders or 80 imaginary jump rope**

**1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1 repetitions:**

**Wall balls, dumbbell thrusters (5lb, 3lb), wall ball goblet squats, or sit-to-stands**

**Anchored or assisted sit-ups**

**Buy out: 40 single unders or 80 imaginary jump rope**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**For time:**

**Buy in: 25 double unders or 100 single unders**

**1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1 repetitions:**

**Wall balls (14lb, 10lb)**

**Abmat sit-ups**

**Buy in: 25 double unders or 100 single unders**
