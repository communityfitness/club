[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up)

We’re halfway through the week, Community Fitness Club. Let’s get over the hump by completing 3 rounds of 40 kettlebell box step-ups, 30 kettlebell swings, and 20 sit-ups as quickly as possible. Work hard! You can do it!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**3 rounds for time:**

**40 kettlebell box step-ups (53lb, 35lb), (24in., 20in.)**

**30 American kettlebell swings (53lb, 35lb)**

**20 abmat sit-ups**
<!--more-->

Beginners can modify today’s workout by scaling the rep scheme, lowering the box height and kettlebell weight for the kettlebell box step-ups, and by substituting Russian kettlebell swings for American kettlebell swings. The sit-ups can also be modified as needed. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**3 rounds for time:**

**30 kettlebell box step-ups to a comfortable height (20lb, 15lb)**

**20 Russian kettlebell swings (20lb, 15lb)**

**10 anchored or assisted sit-ups**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**3 rounds for time:**

**40 kettlebell box step-ups to a comfortable height (35lb, 22lb)**

**30 American kettlebell swings (35lb, 22lb)**

**20 abmat sit-ups**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
