Christmas is almost here, Community Fitness Club! This week will feature some fun Christmas-themed workouts that you might remember from years past. I hope they will help you get into the spirit of the season!

Let’s kick off the week with a WOD I’ve named “Candy in Your Stocking.” The full “Candy” benchmark workout is quite long: 5 rounds of 20 pull-ups, 40 push-ups, and 60 air squats. However, we’re going to miniaturize her a bit today, so she’ll fit in our Christmas stockings. I hope you enjoy your Christmas “Candy”!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

***“Candy” in Your Stocking***

**Experienced:**

**5 rounds for time:**

**10 pull-ups**

**20 push-ups**

**30 air squats**
<!--more-->

Beginners can modify both the movements and the rep scheme in today’s workout. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**10 rounds for time:**

**5 ring rows**

**10 wall push-ups**

**15 air squats or sit-to-stands**

Intermediate athletes can choose other modifications for the movements. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**5 rounds for time:**

**10 jumping or banded pull-ups**

**20 kneeling push-ups or box push-ups**

**30 air squats**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
