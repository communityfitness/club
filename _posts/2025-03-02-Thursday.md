[Warm-up](https://communityfitnessclub.wixsite.com/website/post/basic-full-body-warm-up) 

Today’s WOD (“Workout of the Day”) is an AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”). You will perform 4 dumbbell push jerks, 8 dumbbell overhead walking lunges, and 12/10 calories on the air bike each round, trying to complete as many rounds and reps as possible in the 14 minute workout period. Really push hard to get in as many rounds and repetitions as you can! You can do it!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**14 minute AMRAP:**

**4 dumbbell push jerks (50lb, 35lb)**

**8 dumbbell overhead walking lunges (50lb, 35lb)**

**12/10 calorie air bike**
<!--more-->

Pick a dumbbell weight that works for you today. If lunges are difficult, please modify them as needed. Hold onto something for balance, take smaller steps, or don’t lower your back knee as close to the ground. It’s okay if you can’t perform a movement perfectly! Just do your best, and that’s good enough. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**14 minute AMRAP:**

**4 dumbbell push jerks or push presses (8lb, 5lb)**

**8 modified lunges**

**8/6 calorie air bike**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**14 minute AMRAP:**

**4 dumbbell push jerks (35lb, 25lb)**

**8 dumbbell walking lunges (35lb, 25lb)**

**10/8 calorie air bike**

Your score is the total number or rounds and repetitions you complete during today’s twelve minute workout.
