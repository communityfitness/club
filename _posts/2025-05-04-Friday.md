It’s finally Friday, Community Fitness Club! Let’s end the week strong with a 15 minute AMRAP (“As Many Reps As Possible”) consisting of rounds of 5 pull-ups, 3 power cleans, and 10 dumbbell walking lunges. Pick a heavier weight for your power cleans today. It’s okay to do 3 quick singles if you need to instead of trying to do the set unbroken. Challenge yourself! You can do it!

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**5 pull-ups**

**3 power cleans (135lb, 95lb)**

**10 dumbbell walking lunges (50lb, 35lb)**
<!--more-->

Beginners can substitute ring rows for pull-ups, dumbbell power cleans for power cleans with a barbell, and modified lunges for dumbbell overhead walking lunges. The rep scheme can also be modified. A beginner’s version of today’s WOD could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**4 ring rows**

**3 dumbbell power cleans (15lb, 10lb)**

**8 modified lunges**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**15 minute AMRAP:**

**5 jumping pull-ups or banded pull-ups**

**3 power cleans (95lb, 65lb)**

**10 dumbbell dumbbell walking lunges (35lb, 25lb)**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total number of rounds and repetitions you complete during today’s workout.
