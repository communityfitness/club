Happy Valentine’s Day, Community Fitness Club! Let’s celebrate with a quick workout I call “WOD You Be My Valentine?” Have fun, and let your loved ones know how much you care about them today! 

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

***WOD You Be My Valentine?***

**Experienced:**

**2 rounds for time:**

**14 deadlifts (105lb, 75lb)**

**14 hang power cleans (105lb, 75lb)**

**14 push jerks (105lb, 75lb)**

**14 burpees**

**14 calorie air bike**
<!--more-->

Beginners can modify both the movements and the weights. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**2 rounds for time:**

**14 dumbbell deadlifts (10lb, 5lb)**

**14 dumbbell hang power cleans (10lb, 5lb)**

**14 dumbbell push jerks (10lb, 5lb)**

**14 elevated, no push-up burpees**

**7 calorie air bike**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**2 rounds for time:**

**14 deadlifts (75lb, 55lb)**

**14 hang power cleans (75lb, 55lb)**

**14 push jerks (75lb, 55lb)**

**14 step-back burpees**

**14 calorie air bike**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s WOD.
