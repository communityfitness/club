Happy Boxing Day, Community Fitness Club! In today’s workout, we will complete as many burpee box jump overs as we can in ten minutes. Pacing is key in today’s WOD. Try to pick a pace that you can maintain, and just keep moving! If your box jumps start to get shaky, please switch to box step-ups instead. You’ll still get in an excellent workout while avoiding the chance of injury.

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

***Boxing Day***

**Experienced:**

**10 minute AMRAP:**

**Burpee box jump overs (24in., 20in.)**
<!--more-->

Scale today’s workout in a way that makes sense for you. A beginner can complete elevated burpees with a plyo box and then do the box jumps on a smaller object such as a 45 pound plate or step. Do what works for you! A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**10 minute AMRAP:**

**10 elevated, no push-up burpees**

**10 box jumps to a comfortable height**

Perhaps something between the experienced version and the beginner version of the WOD is right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**10 minute AMRAP:**

**Step-back burpee box jump overs to a comfortable height**

Please listen to your body, and pick the version of the workout that is right for you. You can always adjust mid-WOD if you find that the modifications you’ve picked are too easy or too difficult.

Your score is the total number of burpee box jump overs you complete in today’s workout.
