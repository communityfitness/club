Welcome to a (hopefully) beautiful June week, Community Fitness Club! We will kick off the new month with a workout consisting of 6 rounds of a 300 meter row, 5 thrusters, and 10 burpees. Pace yourself today and pick a weight for the thrusters that is challenging but that you can complete unbroken. There’s no need to go out super fast today. Try to make your rounds as uniform as possible.

If you are an experienced athlete and feel capable, please perform the following WOD:

**Experienced:**

**6 rounds for time:**

**300 meter row**

**5 thrusters (105lb, 75lb)**

**10 burpees**
<!--more-->

Beginners can modify today’s workout by scaling the number of rounds and by modifying the movements. Thrusters with a barbell can be too difficult for some beginners, so pick a scaled option that works for you. Dumbbell thrusters, air squats, and sit-to-stands are all great substitutions. Beginners can also modify the burpees in today’s WOD. A beginner’s version of today’s workout could look like this:

**Scaled 1:**

**5 rounds for time:**

**300 meter row**

**5 dumbbell thrusters (8lb, 5lb) or air squats or sit-to-stands**

**10 elevated, no push-up burpees**

Many people will be able to complete the full workout if they simply reduce the weight of the thrusters and scale the burpees appropriately. Make the modifications that are right for you today. Another variation of today’s WOD might look like this:

**Scaled 2:**

**6 rounds for time:**

**300m row**

**5 thrusters (75lb, 55lb)**

**10 step-back burpees**

Your score is the total amount of time it takes you to complete today’s workout.
